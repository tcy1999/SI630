11362,"I don't think isolationist is the right word for Harper Government foreign policy. It mimics a Republican brand of aggressive, unilateralist US policy that was most associated with the early Bush years, much admired by S. Harper at the time. This policy was disastrous for the US and it's image, and has been rejected by most Americans. Of course, it's adapted for Canada, but it has a lot of the same elements and attitude. It made the US disliked. On Canada, as a middle power, rather than a super power, to the extent it's noticed, not much if we're lucky, it just looks odd, and betrays the values for which Canada has long been appreciated. Btw, we shouldn't refer to the Progressive Conservative Party as the Conservative Party. It was quite different."
5046,"“the polls say this issue is a loser”No they don’t, and the outdated results you’re referring to are the result of media coverage skewed to such an end. But despite the willingness of the Establishment media to misrepresent the situation and repeat the fearmongering nonsense of those who base policy decisions on personal prejudice, a radical political ideology, and cultish beliefs (and important key fact the media that endorsed Harper ahead of the last election refuses to discuss), most Canadians continue to support these refugees and want to help them. As proven by polls conducted by the independent press which did not fail to predict (or perhaps, more accurately, to report) the drubbing the Neo-Liberals would receive in the last election, and the ascendancy of the NDP, as the private pollsters did. They also know why this is happening, even though the politicians and media that speaks for them has conspicuously gone out of their way not to link it to the criminal wars of the last 24 years, and those currently being waged by the US and its co-conspirators in the name of weakening Iran and Russia, protecting and expanding their own regional hegemony, and controlling others’ resources.“A new Ipsos poll, conducted Sept. 11-13”More recent mainstream polling has shown the opposite to be true. Way to “cherry pick” …“it’s worth noting that Canada stalled for years before taking in the boat people”And our government turned away Jews fleeing the Holocaust …“a very troubled neighbourhood, where people have been killing each other for quite a while”People like the Israelis, British, and Americans … Especially since the US and its co-conspirators prosecuted the criminal invasion of Iraq, then when nothing was done to hold them accountable, went on to prosecute criminal wars in Yemen, Libya, Syria, etc. and support terrorists to act as proxies, including elements of al Qaeda and those that went on to form IS.“will no doubt keep on doing so for years to come”If we do absolutely nothing to stop them, and the press continues to act as a willing participant, certainly. Or we can have the debate this crisis is begging for, and begin to reign in these states and begin to protect and enforce the Rule of Law. That would change things pretty quick, and ensure that crises like this one don’t happen again, at least on such a massive scale.“For every child we rescue and send to school, there are thousands of kids in camps with no schools at all”So we shouldn’t help more of them … ? I don’t see your point."
5420,The Canadian foreign policy will be increasingly defined by the nationality of the immigrants who will progressively subdue Anglo-Saxon element. The policy issues would be solved according to third-world recipes and instructions coming from Palestine and China.

8538,"Trudeau's views on ISIS and Canada's roll remind me of Jean Chretien's very obtuse reaction to 9/11.At some level, both Trudeau and Chretien seemed to understand the gravity of their respective situations, but neither was prepared to do much about it. I like my leaders to have a bit more defiance."
1347,"Thank you for speaking your mind on such issues such as citizenship, voting and the true Canadian values that have been so blatantly changed by this government. Mr.Sutherland please do us a favour and continue to write on such important matters....we are proud of what you have achieved in life and even more proud that you are a true Canadian."
2251,"Lysiane you are also very sweet but not much of a journalist. Just a reminder , I was a senior executive with the federal government and Harper was clearly no expert on international affairs when he first ran for PM. To expect any one to have all the answers at this stage of the game is unfair. There is no question that Harper is toast , he may actually not even be the leader of the opposition if you look at the latest EKOS poll."
1570,Maybe he did not accept the Conservative-offered childcare tax break before the election because he did not think it was enough ... and was holding out for more. Looks like he got it. ;-) Just playing devil's advocate for a moment.
1807,The Koran does not require a woman to wear a niqab.
2215,Thank you for using the word citizen. Being a citizen means something. It is more than where you live. It is more than where you pay your taxes. There are no degrees of citizenship. There are good and bad citizens but they are all citizens. The Harper government does not understand this. Just ask the only citizen of a western democracy to be left by his country to languish in Gitmo. He also happened to have been a child when he was arrested. He just wasn't the kind of citizen the Harper Government likes. They pick and choose the citizens they like for the electoral advantage of appealing to the baseness of their base. It is very sad.

5425,"Mulcair nailed it! I get the feeling that president Harper wants his war......how would be remembered without a war to his credit?.....no honour, no glory, no parade, no statues. ISIS or Al Queda or whatever they are called today want western soldiers on the ground. They want bombs falling, they want the videos of dead children and mothers wailing. They want christian foriegn invaders that have to be driven out. They want to be seen as heros fighting drive out the infadel. That way the money flows in and the recruits come in a torrent. They want us us spending billions of tax dollars, bankrupting our countries fighting wars with 10,000 mile supply lines using technology that costs tens of millions a day. The military equipment we will be targeting was a gift to the Iraqis from the Americans. If we would have just used B-52's and dumped a couple of trillion in cash in 2003 instead of invading both we and the Iraqis would be a lot better off right now"
5603,"The question I always ask is, Is this a reasonable choice? Is the person well qualified? I'm not necessarily looking for balance, I'm looking for good use of the talent available. But still, I find it encouraging that Trudeau appointed an indigenous Minister of Justice, and a Sikh Minister of Defence."

7296,"You want to deny global warning based on a cold snap in January? And the same tired old refrain that one data set says there was no net warming in the past 16 years, when 1998 was the hottest year on record? The Arctic sea ice is dwindling away year after year, and no statistical revisionism can change that. Ask any Inuit over the age of 40 and they'll tell you that they have shorter winters there than 40-50 years ago. If the global warming deniers don't jump on the bandwagon, they'll be left out in the cold!"
5762,This is OK....people have to remember that Trudeau comes from Quebec where stunts like this are acceptable. Hypocricy there is okay.
1324,"The 'advanced' anti-fossil fuel agenda of Europe is falling apart. Germany and Britain are abandoning subsidies for a failed 'green' energy agenda, having wasted billions and created the most expensive power in the world, except maybe for Ontariowe. If not for the Euro currency, Germany's economy would be damaged badly bythe cost of their power and its effect on manufacturing costs. And meanwhile, Indian and China and other countries are laughing all the way to the destruction of our industrial and manufacturing sector, enjoying not only the advantage of human resources, but of citizens and government who actually want their nations to have jobs, not placards and 'agendas'."
2350,"Hell is freezing over! Even the BBC is forced to recognize the stall in global warming.'By contrast the new model, known as HadGEM3, gives a rise about one-fifth lower than that of 0.43C - within a range of 0.28-0.59.This would be only slightly higher that the record year of 1998 - in which the Pacific Ocean's El Nino effect was thought to have added more warming. If the forecast is accurate, the result would be that the global average temperature would have remained relatively static for about two decades.'Note that the article is sloppily written. The 0.43 degrees mentioned is not further warming, it's where we are now. The UK Met office is predicting no further warming for another five years. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20947224"
3594,"Wente's been grinding out this stale argument for years. Given her own demonstrated lack of mathematical skills, pedagogical aptitude, or ability to synthesize research, statistics and outcomes on the topic the question is why anyone bothers to pay attention in the first place."
11022,"Wente's logic is off the mark. Rest assured a few nutty viewpoints have not poisoned entire university campuses. And I'm not sure where this idea 'B-schools are politically neutral' comes from but I assure you the ones I attended were definitely not. Regardless, my beliefs were not threatened or abused by my business profs or the arts department. Perhaps we can all take a step back rather than conjuring Wente's delusions of grandeur."
4625,Well done Mr. Simpson.
307,"THE ARCTIC SEEMS TO BE WARMING UP.Reports from fishermen, seal hunters, and explorers who sail the seas about Spitzbergen and the eastern Arctic, all point to a radical change in climatic conditions and hitherto un-heard-of high temperatures in that part of the earth's surface. In August, 1922, the Norwegian Department of Commerce sent an expedition to Spitzbergen and Bear Island under the leadership of Dr. Adolf Hoel, lecturer on geology at the University of Christiania. In connection with Dr. Hoel's report, it is interest to note the unusually warm summer in Arctic Norway and the observations of Capt. Martin Ingebrigtsen, who has sailed the eastern Arctic for 54 years past. He says that he first noted warmer conditions in 1915, that since that time it has steadily gotten warmer, and that to-day the Arctic of that region is not recognizable as the same region of 1865 to 1917. Many old landmarks are so changed as to be unrecognizable. Where formerly great masses of ice were found, there are now often moraines, accumulations of earth and stones. At many points where glaciers formerly extended far into the sea they have entirely disappeared. The change in temperature, says Captain Ingebrigtsen has also brought about great change in the flora and fauna of the Arctic. This summer he sought for white fish in Spitzbergen waters. Formerly great shoals of them were found there. This year he saw none, although he visited all the old fishing grounds.

10408,"And yet, sadly for Conservative supporters, there is the newly released Nanos Party Power Index, which still has the Liberals far ahead of the Cons, who are barely ahead of the NDP. What Nanos(which has had a very successful polling track record) indicates is that Trudeau's 'lousy week'(if that is,indeed,what it was)is not nearly enough to make Canadians forget their suspicion and dislike of a leader who has hit new lows in partisanship, negativity,secrecy and outright deceit. And,oh yes, there is the looming spectre of next year's Duffy trial. The clock is ticking, Harperites. Enjoy your leader's last year in power, for it's all that you're going to have. For a very, very long time....."
7461,"OMG. Wente should be the last person to try to summary research findings... Where to start... Let's start with salt... Another summary of the Institute of Medicine report looks like this: However, this article (cited by Wented)– in focusing on a lack of evidence for the lower-limit recommendation of 1,500 mg sodium per day – risks misleading people because it overlooks the main finding of the Institute of Medicine report, which was that the current dietary guideline recommendation of 2,300 mg of sodium per day for the general population is in fact supported by ample research. As stated in the Institute of Medicine press release, “Recent studies that examine links between sodium consumption and health outcomes support recommendations to lower sodium intake from the very high levels some Americans consume now.” The current average daily sodium intake is about 3,400 mg per day, meaning that Americans should still monitor and attempt to reduce their intake in order to achieve optimal health."

1375,"I agree with Wente whole heartedly. It is time to re-visit the guidelines for the number of firefighters required per population. If the frequency of fires is 36% less, then it stands to reason we need 36% fewer firefighters. I do not put police in the same category, however. It is a more dangerous and otherwise demanding job, by miles."

5055,"Andrea Horwath is finished. She just hasn't acknowledged it yet. I heard Howard Hampton say that her position was secure because she hadn't lost any ground in terms of seats. This ignores the reality that she squandered the best opportunity she had to influence public policy. Now she has none. Zero. Most NDP supporters are perfectly aware that they're unlikely to form a government in this province. Let's face it, 1990 was an anomaly, and nobody, the NDP included, saw it coming. The party has a long and distinguished tradition of leveraging its influence in minority governments, and most members accept that the most likely role of the party in unexceptional times will be that of the 'conscience' of the province. That's what hardcore NDPers (myself included) were objecting to--the abandonment of that role with no realistic chance of making significant gains beyond that. Now it's gone. I'm afraid the knives will be out. Ms. Horwath should step down sooner rather than later to heal the rift in the party that she created. The NDP will be ineffectual until she's gone and the party returns to its roots."

6043,"The BLM group has a legitimate beef against prejudice in the USA. But definitely not in Canada, where equality has long ruled. Further, BLM made a mistake causing trouble for Pride. Biting the hands that feeds them, alienating those who would be their allies, hurting their close allies for no good reason. If BLM wants to cause civil unrest, so be it, but choose a legitimate target to damage, not Pride. The outcome here is very damaging to the BLM's acceptance in Canada.

Sadly, the people in line to succeed them are just as incompetent."

Why should hard working Candians have to try and be parents when we work so hard at be hard workers. Oh did I mention Candians are such hard workers and especially the unselfish people who work for the Federal government and never think of themselves. Here is how I will pull this off. Fist we bring in 15 million people from Syria so our children and our childrens children will learn the ways of Muslims and speak Arabic or Farsie(not sure of the spelling sorry)My second option would be to bring in Chineese people and get started on real asian trade as Canada will never be Canada again so get used to it.Yes the English has gone and so will be the french but I do not expect them to stay around for more than 10 years. If you want me to get started now please send money (preferably in American funds to Paul Stephensons happy life funds. This wil get me started on campaign pens and coasters. I may even go overboard and get some mouse pads. Have a great day Canada and dont forget if we keep our heads in the sand nothing can hurt us.

8379,"Both of our son's were enrolled in early french immersion programs in Toronto. Both returned to the english stream. One in grade 2, the other in grade 9. Both, still in high school, struggle with reading and writing in english. We were the classic naive parents, thinking we were doing what was best for our sons. In hindsight, it was a mistake that many of today's parents are certain to repeat. We found the teachers in the English stream, as a group, superior to the French Immersion teachers. French Immersion teachers are difficult to find in Toronto. A large number were students themselves in French Immersion. French is not their first language and it effects their ability to teach. I would not recommend that parent's today enroll their child in French Immersion unless French is spoken as the language of choice in the home. In this way the child truly is immeresed in the language."

I pay my taxes, obey Canadian laws, and add to the productivity of your fine country. But I will most likely be leaving. I would love to become Canadian (Or at a minimum a permanent resident) and stay to open a business in Vancouver, but when my permit expires in 2015 I will be leaving. Here is why: To become PR, I have to jump through an endless paperwork hoop, including but not limited to, 4 background checks, 12 months of waiting, and the kicker here, an ENGLISH test (for $300). I have 2 university degrees from US institutions and find this English test more of a money grab than an actual path towards PR or citizenship. So instead of spending a year of my life and $1000 for each member of my family jumping through the hoops and English test, I will pack my bags at the end of my permit, and be done. Why not file today? Well if the requirements and price of admission is set so high, I don't see the benefit of sticking around, when I can move to my home an hour south, where I can do everything I do here. So I am self eliminating myself from the process. I guess that means there will be less paperwork for your govt to process, and while it won't matter to most, 2 less people contributing to the economy.

Is this because we're good at tearing stuff down but inept when it comes to --admittedly more difficult-- reconstruction? Or do we have a stake in perpetual war? Perhaps Canada should leave the 'containment' and 'degradation' of ISIS in Syria to regional players (and the US) --and focus its efforts on nation building in Iraq --suporting dialogue among various factions, training for 'internal' security, fostering, helping to broker, the political institutions that will make another descent into chaos less likely. Even if ISIS (per se) is 'defeated', without political resolutions/stability, other sectarian extremist groups will emerge --and we'll have more humantiarian crises. We should either get out and leave it to the locals, or focus on humanitarian aid and offer support in nation-building.(Harper, unfortunately, doesn't have much experience with nation-building; thrives on division and animosity.)"

How do we now address someone we have never met before when we want to pass 'them' a shell in the trenches? We are now correct, so to speak, to the point of self-destructive lunacy -- and all because of pc pronouns and the willingness of 'authorities' to cave in before being overrun by the nuisance of it all.

In the case of the former, how many articles were penned about a lame-duck presidency when in fact, consider how much more intelligent and respectable Obama's presidency was for the U.S than G.W.B's (hint: one of them didn't all but ruin the country by spending trillions on an unjustified war and kick off a secretive domestic spying agenda that would plunge North America into a decade long bout of paranoia that still persists today). The Globe and Post's consistent endorsements of Harper's xenophobic, divisive, secretive not to mention overall negative government, Maclean's fervent endorsement of Rob Ford are in the very same league as The NY Post backing Bush over Gore and Kerry. Constituents hold their governments but also their media to account for their endorsements. Would it be too painfully honest of journalism to admit that conservatism has damaged North America enough since the turn of the century? In my opinion, it's safe to say that it's time to try something else and that includes phasing out the very editorial cynicism that largely helped elect people like Bush, Ford and Harper to the detriment of both their supporters and detractors alike."

Liberal democracy is probably the best form of government ever developed but it's far from perfect so perhaps it's most stringent adherents would at least admit some of their own deficiencies and listen as much as they preach."

1504,"I see my post about Byrne blaming the media didn't make it through. All the major papers in this country, most with TV, radio and magazine branches, supported Harper and the Cons in the last election. Post Media even ran front page ads on election day with a mock up of an electoral ballot, marked for Harper. How that is not illegal, I do not know. Blaming the media as liberal is just one of many awful US Tea Party Republican ideas Harper borrowed. If the Cons ever want back into power, they need to learn the meaning of 'Tory' and 'Progressive Conservative'. Especially in these times, no one needs the politics of division. YOu want that, come to Alberta and watch former Harper minister Brian Jean stir hate against an NDP government that is really doing the only thing it can."
1828,"Stupid, stupid, stupid."
5452,"Not to defend Trudeau's tactics here, but from what I've read, the NDP particularly, were also physically preventing the conservative whip from walking down the aisle to the speakers chair, which is a requirement. This was deliberate game playing and Trudeau decided he would play too. It obviously didn't turn out the way he'd hoped with the accidental elbowing but all of this is just a bunch of political game playing."

Too badHousing bubble? Too badMP's can't represent their constituants?

2475,"Before the 2011 election the Globe and mail despite the evidence they quoted in their endorsement (... his grip on Parliament, its independent officers and the flow of information,... a disrespect for Parliament, the abuse of prorogation, the repeated attempts (including during this campaign) to stanch debate and free expression... a disappointing failing in a leader ...).finished by saying: ' If the result is a confident new Parliament, it could help propel Canada into a fresh period of innovation, government reform and global ambition. Stephen Harper and the Conservatives are best positioned to guide Canada there.'This editorial maintains that tone despite the evidence. Time for the Globe and Mail to wake up and recognize that Harper is every bit the Harper the evidence indicates. No government reform, no innovation, no global ambition. Just Harper being Harper. Duffy is just an example of the consequences."

8375,"This government is and always has been the Canadian version of the far right of the Republican Party. They believe what the Republicans do; they are willing to use GOP tactics to get what they want. The CP has focused on dividing Canada, as you note, focusing only on the fanatical base and hoping it can swing over the other 5-10% it needs to win elections as the majority of the vote is divided between the centre-left parties that reflect the wishes and values of most Canadians. The CP is anti-science, anti-knowledge, and viciously partisan. It hates people who actually know things because, most often, facts and knowledge actually run contrary to the political values and ideology of the CP. Let's have no more debates about whether or not Harper has a 'secret agenda.' He does and it is not so secret anymore. Indeed, it was never secret; it's just that he was more subtle and surreptitious in how he went about implementing it. Now, with the 'Fair Elections Act', the Conservatives are out in the open. The true nature of how radical they are is obvious to everyone. Again, this has been evident for a long time. I teach and study Canadian foreign policy and, from day one, it was obvious that the CP was driven by ideology, religion and the hope for domestic political gain by appealing to various ethnic and religious voting blocs in foreign policy. But, even in domestic policy, it was going after its ideological opponents from the beginning. Now, it has decided to stop hiding what it is. Hopefully, enough Canadians are paying attention to care."

These ticked off people will not be asking officials to tackle the Aboriginal problems , but to do something about the problem Aboriginals. Protest should focus on the actual people with the power to solve the problems. Focus should be on the members of Parliament and especially the useless chiefs.

3245,"I have to agree with Wente. I was in highschool when Trudeau brought in the French Immersion mandate but it was only K-Grade 10 so I missed out on it. However my wife was in French Immersion and she had a scholarship to study French at a Quebec school during the summer ( and we live in Victoria ). Her problem was the same as many other who learned passable French as kids - you use it or you lose it.She would have been better off studying Mandarin instead of French . At least with that you could go down to Chinatown and practice what you learned. Learning French in Western Canada is a waste of time because your chances of using it on a daily basis is marginal. You see the difference everywhere. Air Canada has its stewardesses and stewards give the safety info in French while WestJet simply plays a tape recording during the French part of the message. If the kid can't use it , the kid will eventually lose it."

1290,"With all due respect Ms. Khan, there are Muslim Conservative candidates in this election; the idea that the Conservatives are 'anti-muslim' is completely false. The niqab is representative of a culture that is fundamentally incompatible with Canadian values. It is not just a garment, it is a symbol of female oppression and submission to a male authority figure. It doesn't matter how many op-eds are written, it doesn't change the fact that every country where the niqab is common is faces increased religious extremism and treat women as inferior citizens. The niqab is simply part of an agenda by political Islamists to gain more accommodations for fundamentalist practices in Canada. Canadians have seen the results in Europe when new immigrants don't integrate and it creates segregated communities - the overwhelming majority of Canadians are against cultural segregation, which is why they oppose the niqab."

2241,"'Black lives matter, too' would probably quell the pointless argument about semantics. And not that it was intended, but the headline is offensive. The fact that some choose to point out that all lives matter, clearly a universal truth, does not make the statement ignorant. It just fails to appreciate the motives of the action in this particular endeavour. The individuals protesting on behalf of 'Black Lives Matter' are as entitled to their day in the spotlight as any other disenfranchised group… 'Pride', PETA, and First Nations. So long as they don't cross the line into diminishing the values of any other group. Then they become the oppressors, not the victims, which is why I thing there was such negative backlash about BLM hijacking the Pride Parade. It is ok to promote your views, so long as it doesn't interfere with someone else promoting theirs."

Mr. Simpson clearly doesn't appreciate Mr. Paul's views but his disrespect for the man is unwarranted. If I was Mr. Simpson I would apologize. With today's version of politician being about as dishonest and slimy as they come, I find it refreshing that there is one guy who is consistent and honest about what he believes. Name one socialist, democrat, or liberal that is as open, honest, and passionate as Ron Paul. Even if you don't agree with him, you gotta respect him."
5539,"What judgment? Trudeau made it clear that these were only allegations, and he did not say what the allegations or who the complainants were. The only judgment being made here is that of Tom Flanagan, a Conservative, against Trudeau. This was clearly a partisan article."
2244,"Interesting how the article does not talk about the shocking amount of emergency services personnel who are committing suicide due to the horrible events they see during the course of there shifts, or that firefighters have over a 40hr work week. Doesn't talk about how fires are now burning hotter and faster than every before, due to the combustible materials being used to build homes(just check with the National institute for standards and technology). Nor does the article explain how emotionally taxing it is to perform life saving techniques on a patient while the family is screaming and crying for you to bring back their loved one. How about explaining cutting a family out of a car wreck when their youngest child had passed, but the parents are still alive. How about explaining how emergency services have to clean up body parts after a person had been hit by a car or a train. Instead of being angry with firefighters try asking yourself why athletes and politicians are being paid more than doctors, surgeons, scientists, nurses, teachers, armed forces, police, paramedics, and firefighters. Those are the men and women who save, prolong, treat, teach, rescue, and protect LIVES! Just maybe try walking a walking a few miles in the shoes of the people I mentioned above before you comment on how they are overpaid and underworked."
7139,I think the elbow was an accident but what I find appalling is the way Trudeau grabbed and dragged Gordon Brown. It was like watching a dog being dragged on a leash. I am surprised Brown did not (and he have every right to) tell Trudeau to take his hands off of his arm or physically remove Trudeau's hand. Instinctively I would have gone into self defence mode and removed Trudeau's hand.

To move boldly and quickly such change is best imposed by a powerful collective authority guided by those, such as themselves and other progressive thinkers, who know what is right for us all and demand we act accordingly. I wonder what would be the fate of a dissenter given that the most private action is that of the individual thinker?"

I would like to see the actual numbers. Many people assume just because they use the term 'conservative' in their party name that they are prudent and reserved. Some of the most unreserved actions and policies have been executed by the PCs and subsequently by the Harper Cons. Have you forgotten that the Liberals left the Cons a significant surplus, which they promptly squandered by cutting taxes to the richest Canadians and to business. I find it irresponsible of the Globe and Mail to publish subjective information rather than the facts."
2229,"As the editorial says, the other parties have not really indicated a significant change to the direction of government, so why take the risk of keeping Harper for the sake of avoiding very little change, except for being rid of Harper. The reason Harper is so mean and petty is that he desires power above all else, which is probably proven by the fact that all the best minds in the Conservative government left before this election. They obviously know that Harper is not going to get out of the way, so what is the point of sticking around. So the editorial really fails to show the courage to advise the best outcome for Canada, which is the defeat of the Conservatives so that Harper will leave. Then maybe the skilled people who left will be willing to come back to turn the party back to the reasonable right of centre choice it used to be."

9025,"Wente's first sentence: 'I actually feel a little sorry for the Royal Bank of Canada.' is already her first mistake. She may be disappointed once she realizes that a bank will never ever feel sorry for anyone in return. It is, in fact, another integral part of their efficiency strategy. Her next stupidity comes only a few sentences later: 'But don't blame greedy capitalists for your distress. Blame technology.' This argument is a bit like a reverse ''guns don't kill people but people kill people ''. Technology itself is not the threat, Wente, it is how it is applied and by whose hands. Having said that, technology does change drastically which skills are suddenly required and which no longer. Retraining is something both companies and governments should be investing in, but often do too late or ineffectively. Now here is Wente's example: ''Radiologists – among the highest-paid professionals in medicine – are facing brutal competition from outsourcing, because anyone can read a diagnostic scan.''. Is it true that this is all radiologists do? And does a patient rather have his diagnosis made by someone in Mumbai than by the radiologist at the local hospital. I believe that radiologists will have their high paying job for a long time to come. Let's be honest Ms Wente the outrage about Banks outsourcing has more to do with the greed bank CEO have displayed in other areas, in particular the disproportionate rewarding of the tip management and bonus culture, while laying off lower people left, right and centre. And governments should be upset too when they see companies spend hundreds of millions on paychecks for a few while company workers get transferred to the tax payers welfare roll. So the ''you're losing your job to a computer'' story is a little simplistic, or a load of bollocks, if one prefers."

9218,"While much of Ron Paul's platform was incredibly simplistic, his arguments that there is a limit to US 'force projection' in the world were absolutely spot on. The late CIA analyst and author Chalmers Johnson argued much the same thing in his book 'Blowback'.However, Mr. Simpson is entirely correct in his argument that every government faces the same reality: inertia followed by soft corruption and 'troughing' leading to eventual dumping. It's important to note just how wrong pre-election polls have been lately, in Alberta, in Quebec, in the US and even in Israel's recent election. Each featured a last-week shift that went against the perceived notion. Wildrose was denied despite being far ahead; The PQ was denied a majority despite clear fatigue with Charest's Liberals; Obama prevailed despite lacklustre support and anaemic approval ratings, and Netanyahu was completely denied the clear victory that was supposed to be a sure thing. Anyone who thinks Harper is safe due to perceived vote-splitting or Liberal weakness is 'whistling past the graveyard'. The new normal for voters may well be 'when in doubt, throw them out.'"

8391,"Dear Mr. Simpson, thank you for paying some attention to this problem! It is indeed not a very 'sexy' issue, certainly not for politicians trying to get elected. Taking the long view, the decades-long view, pays very little reward in the near future. And yet, this is arguably the central task of government: to spend public money responsibly within the bounds imposed by the limits of its income, taxation. This or that particular minor policy excepted, at the end of the day it's how governments spend money that counts, that enables (or not) all other policy. If we had limitless funds, we could afford limitless green energy, limitless infrastructure, limitless social policies. But we don't, so we have to make choices. When a government like the Liberals chooses to spend far beyond the income it has, this is a form of cheating. With situations like war or national emergencies excepted, spending more than one takes in is stealing money away from future generations. (Spending billions to gain the votes of a particular group, and millions in campaign advertising, in this case that of the public sector unions, is even worse: corruption.) And not just future, the Liberals' actions over the last ten years already cost us huge, huge sums of money in interest on debt: $165 billion new debt * 4% (typical long-term bond yield) = $6.6 billion/year. Imagine what we could do with an additional $6.6 billion per year! To reiterate (all figures can be found on the Ontario Ministry of Finance website: 2003-2004 - $139 billion debt2013-2014 - $304.4 billion debtTotal new Liberal debt: $165.4 billion, an increase of 119%."
11538,"Well, it's really no surprise that they are doing it, given the last few elections, but it is surprising that the G&M would start campaigning for the Harperoids so fast out of the gate. Why not put a banner across the top of the page: 'Don't look here for balanced election coverage' and leave it there for the next three months. (Sad thing is, there is virtually nowhere to look anymore. The Chronicle Herald was alone in doing a half decent job of covering the last campaign, but it seems to have fallen on three-day a week hard times now too)."
9212,"Almost anyone can be a firefighter- ALL of the people who came through my office had either a four year degree in things like engineering or kinesiology, or had full red seal trades like electrical or carpentry; not to mention all the other courses much too long to list here that they pay for out of pocket with no guarantee of employment. Oh, and being in tip top shape to pass a brutal physical test. You need smarts, courage and top physical strength to be a firefighter. Too often I find the people whining about firefighter benefits are failed candidates. Privatize the fire department – I would suggest you watch a 60 minutes segment on CBS, where you can watch someone's house burn to the ground while the private fire department stood around and watched, all because the home owners were late with their payment. The only good thing that came out of that situation was that their kids weren't in the house or they would have been lost also. Firefighting isn't really that dangerous – When I joined we had a guy that thought the same as many of the people who have posted on this story; he thought, great, sit around all day and get paid for it. Two weeks of live fire training and he was gone; all he kept saying was, this wasn't what I expected. That brought us down to three; one fellow died of cancer, most likely brought on by the job, but 20 years ago we weren't able to prove it, like we could today. One of my best friends died of a heart attack at the age of 52 after a fire, one month before retirement and I lost a family member the same way. Some jobs are more dangerous that firefighting, but those people are not deliberately putting themselves in harm's way. No one has to feel sorry for us, we are all big boys and girls with broad shoulders, but to see the losses and cancer/heart attack rates and the shorter life expectancy, to say that firefighting isn't dangerous is ridiculous."

Many applicants talk plainly about money being a factor in their interest in the field. And many of those get into medical school just fine. The cartoon stereotyping of medical students and interns and faculty, it is cloying. All of the above are diverse. Yes, bad things happen with some at times, but that is not the rule or the trend. There is often excellent teaching from those further along in years to those more junior. And many pre-medial students have had diverse life experiences that included failures."
6389,"I think the root cause is Donald Trump represents, or at least appear to represent anger, fear, and hope among those Americans who did lose or believes they lose way more than what they got in this 21st century capitalism, a new era of capitalism that put capital's interest way beyond a nation's interest, that benefits from free flow of capital, internalization, and cheap labor."

However, there may be a method in their madness. There are cases pending before the court where the constitutionality of other of the government's initiatives are being challenged and it may feel this current attack could cause some of the justices to be more cautious. Alternatively, they may be preparing for defeats where they can claim to their base that the court is biased against them. Either way, it is a shocking assault on one of the fundamental institutions that protects our democracy."

It has gotten so bad they no longer even need to hear the scorn of their master's voice. The morning-after regrets of a serial apologizer such as Paul Calandra are worth no more than the rueful promises of a serial wife-beater. And we know that serial behaviour of this nature only gets worse, even as the apologies and fresh promises ring more hollow. Enough! Pity Canada if we vote this sociopathic manipulator and his gang of sycophantic castrati back in to power with another majority."
3067,"Excellent piece. Back around 1979 Conservative PM Joe Clark said 'Canada is a community of communities'. Community has now been replaced by individualism, singles and families struggling in their own bubbles of insecurity. Back around 1979, it was always said that 'What unites us is greater than what divides us.' No matter our politics or our finances, there was a higher intuitive spirit of common ground and inclusiveness. That ideal of one country one people has been destroyed by fear and greed, the politics of mean-spirited egotism."

I guess Germany should have agreed to supply Greece with endless buckets of Euros, with the German workers effectively devoting some percentage of their labour and money to supporting the Greeks in the style to which they have become accustomed. And let's not forget that other Eurozone countries and their workers would have had to do the same to support Greece... for how long? Probably forever since the Greeks and their leaders show no interest in putting their house in order, and would prefer to depend on bailouts."
5040,"IS cannot be considered a 'fringe cult' at this point - if not for months of coalition bombing they would now be in control of Iraq, Syria and threatening the other neighbours: Turkey, Jordan, Gulf states, Arabia and beyond. They were easily able to defeat Iraqi forces and without US coalition (and now Russian) interference they would have dispatched Assad & henchmen long since. Both their ideology and strategy are much more than 'fringe' and we should be grateful for the bombing that has at least kept them to a simmer, rather than a boil. In fact they're like more than one kind of boil... It is clear that this infection reaches well beyond the Levant, not only through excursions out of there but with the hundreds of would-be jihadists coming from western democracies and thousands of 'allies' in north Africa. On the ideological front, I'm not sure western civilization remembers what western civilization is - most seem to think it's all about personal gratification. The poison is right in our society, recruiting children right in our schools and communities, preached in mosques all over the world. Sure they quieten down and send out some apologists after an incident, but it doesn't take long and we're partying and prancing around the street with our rainbow flags once more."
68,"Trump scarier than Clinton? Trump despite all his faults is a successful businessman, and malleable. He is not out to make money (probably losing money in terms of his brand value with this, definitely for giving up the Apprentice) or peddle influence. He already backed down on torture, and without saying it directly, is for universal healthcare ('will not let anyone die in the streets').Hillary on the other hand is under investigation, and if was not the State Secretary, would have been indicted. In my company you would have lost your job without question for doing what she did with the server and emails. And look how well government is working now. You can blame the GOP all you want, but the Prez has been a Dem. She is so part of the establishment, taken so much money from Goldman Sachs, the average American is SOL if she gets into power. At least you know with Trump the elitist establishment is really really afraid of him."

Michael Gove, the Education secretary, said that in the future all of England’s 20,000 primary and secondary schools will have to promote British values of tolerance and fairness. The recommendation was one of the chief findings in the wake of the scandal which found that schools in Birmingham had been taken over by Islamists. The review found that one of the school had been funding a Madrassa from its own budget, while at another Muslim children had been taken on trips to Saudi Arabia. A third school regularly broadcast a call to Muslim prayer over the school’s loudspeaker in the playground while another school taught in biology that “evolution is not what we believe”.source : Daily Telegraph June 9 2014"

How anyone could henceforth take your editorials seriously is beyond belief."
8373,The Liberals have lost trust with the 30 billion dollar loan that was not even targeted. Going into debt and bringing in refugees is easy. The difficult stuff is balancing a budget and addressing unemployment. I like the attitude but nothing requiring effort has been done. Undoing the old age requirements was terrible as we cannot afford to pay them in the long term. If they could only give us something positive.
6212,"I would never write Harper off. It would be very dangerous for any of the opposition parties or their supporters to write Harper off. Harper has all the money in the world (thanks to his majority and ability to control our budget bills) so can buy off any votes that respond to being bribed with our own money. He has a PMO that runs like a machine (not our country - the CPC propaganda and attack machine). He has a well oiled CPC funding machine that brings in lots of money from the obedient suckers who have a cult-like attachment to the man and his lies. Most importantly, the man is a shameless cheat and his party has cheated in every election since 2006. The 'Fair Elections Act' paves the way for unprecedented CPC cheating because (as a result of the Act) they will now control the investigation into any electoral fraud complaints. Harper is like a cornered rat with all of the feral rat-like instincts for survival. He will do ANYTHING to survive (yes, even if it means cowering in a closet while CPC men and women prepare to fight just outside the closet door).So write off Harper at your own peril."
5457,"I have never had as little trust in the media and in our leadership as I currently have, and I've been around for a long time (60+ years). I sure as hell have less confidence in Canada's leadership with Trudeau junior in charge. The police are just dogs of the politicians. But our media - supposedly out there to expose lies and deceit - have become part of the problem."
734,The thought of Justin Trudeau trying to make sense to most foreign political leaders is cringe-worthy.
6250,"I believe Canada is on the cust of a sea change in tolerance. The intolerant attitudes rising to the surfaces now - attitudes that for some have been cultivated quietly and nourished on repressed bigotry and racism - have long percolated under the surface of Canadian culture. Every wave of immigrants has had to run the cultural gauntlett to some degree; the greater the difference in language, dress and cultural norms a group exhibits, the stronger the reaction from the base. We're witnessing a last gasp from the old guard. This small group of Canadians are loathe to tolerate the fabric of multiculturalism that most of Canada has long adopted, and they've been seeking someone to act as their collective spokesperson. Of late, they've found that leader in Steven Harper, who has revealed himself as an intellect who can somehow justify turning Canada into a type of caste society. If not for the Supreme Court of Canada we'd be in serious trouble right now. And if not for this election, we wouldn't have a chance to change the conversation. This period of cultural darkness and intolerance will pass. The negativity, dispicable attitudes, and the small-minded lives of the adherants of intolerance will recede. Right-minded Canadians will continue to rise and show newcomers a hand of respect and tolerance by way of a greater example of what it is to be Canadian. Our new immigrants may be different, but they are every bit as decent and worthwhile as those before them that led the way into this country. Our attitudes will eventually become their attitudes, and theirs will become ours. The varied tapestry of everyone's cultural assets should be cherished. But, if we teach bigotry, intolerance, and racism, and we will fall apart as a society. Ultimately, the power of positive thinking and inclusiveness in this society will prevail."
2144,"If we were to have referendums on every major issue without telling which leader supports what position, the majority would agree on the Conservative position. Personality, looks, charm and name recognition play a lot into success getting elected along with having groups working to vilify your opponent so that you look clean and fresh. The fact that Harper got 32% of the vote despite what he was up against shows that Conservatism is still alive and well. Harper didn't have to kiss and cuddle babies, kiss media butt, he just had to be himself as Canadians have reliably known him to be for 9 years. The biggest losers I have known are Kim Campbell and Ignatieff. Mulcair lost the most in this election."
11220,"That headline is an oxymoron....you can't reconcile a cult with any type of normal life. They have to be banned. If anyone within their right mind reads the Qu'ran they have to realize either you are a Muslim and you follow it or your not a Muslim....you can; t have it both ways. It clearly says that women are inferior, it clearly says that all infidels (non-muslims) should die. If you buy into that cult nonsense you need to take it to a country that finds it acceptable. In Canada we do not. All religion is problematic. Most wars and conflicts over the last 250 years have been motivated by religion. We need to escape the hold religion has on the less educated and teach science as an alternative."
8722,Elitist crap... basically saying the more successful the artist the less valuable and authentic their work.

Even the nasty, evil Conservative leader who burped and ate babies for breakfast, Stephen Harper, never resorted to this type of behaviour. Full disclosure: I did not vote for Trudeau during the last election. What I found truly amazing regarding the Prime Minister's (now is that PM? or Hulk Hogan?) latest apology was to watch the Liberal MPs sitting next to him.

As for Mulcair and Turmel saying that they have been 're-victimized', the women in question haven't even been named yet, either by Trudeau or the NDP leader. But, the NDP leadership doesn't mind seeing the reputations of the two Liberal MPs being shredded, even though the investigation hasn't actually begun and no criminal charges have been laid. For the NDP to advertise itself as a champion of 'justice' is truly laughable.,"
507,"This piece simply baffled me. It isn't that 'liberal democracy' is dying in Western nations or the USA, it's that the power of Western propaganda is dying. In other words, liberal democracies are finally coming fully into being, having been emancipated from the grasp of the old elites. The USA could do worse than electing a Trump or Sanders; they could elect another Bush or Clinton. The anti-establishment feelings are real. We, the people, know we've been played by the oligarchs and the vulgarly rich. We are finally saying 'Enough!'"
3414,"You damn with faint praise. In fact, on his watch, Canada, which will never be governed to any group's satisfaction, has remained as strong as it can in face of the cultural destruction wrought by preceding PM's , especially the Pearson/ Trudeau/Chretien brigade who inflicted the phony notion of so-called multiculturalism on a sovereign nation founded by the English and French. He had the moxy to stand up to those who laughed in Canada's face as they stepped off the plane and demanded their rights to wear masks as they 'became citizens'. For this facet of his governance alone, he deserves wide praise. The economy is in decent shape, interest rates are low, and people are able to accomplish their economic objectives. Perfect? No PM ever will be; but he stands provenly head and shoulders above the liberal mob."
8553,Real leaders lead by example and delegate. The age of rulers is over. Perhaps we could demand that the PMO should set an example for chiefs to follow? That would be real leadership.

6372,"A good column, and written for the general readership of the paper. Of course it has (and will) draw the usual angry comments that global warming doesn't exist, etc. but these are coming from a small, disproportionately loud group that aggressively attacks the multidisciplinary scientific research on which our understanding of global warming is based, while producing none of their own (and arguably understanding little of what they criticize).They're good with insults and conspiracy theories but little else, and after two decades this is wearing a bit thin. Although quite a few conservative politicians in Canada, Australia and the U.S. still buy the arguments, apparently."
285,Another simplistic analysis from a partisan con whose only looking to score political pointsHistory will prove who is right. You are caught by emotion and not reason here.

9631,"No, they don't understand voters better. But they are better financed by the big oil, coal, and gas industries, and even in politics unfortunately, advertising works, even if it is false negative advertising. It's how Harper won as well."
2758,"Lost a lot of respect for the Globe & Mail's mismanagement of the debate, far and away the most amateurish hosting of a debate in modern North American political history, and this editorial is not surprisingly also complete garbage."
8385,"I would agree with Bidini if in fact Dylan's lyrics were unable to stand on their own without music and melody. If in fact, he was using his singing and playing to prop up mediocre or substandard lyrics. However that is not the case. If anything, Dylan's music and singing detract from the actual lyrics but the songs stand up anyway! BECAUSE of the strength and depth of his lyrics. This is just sour grapes from writers who don't write songs. Great literature exists in plays, novels, poems and yes indeed, song lyrics! Congratulations Dr. Zimmerman! Mr. Bidini should learn to deal with it."
11183,"Yes, the fact that the Liberals are giving uncosted, unjustified lump sum payouts to their chief political contributors, campaigners and get-out-the-vote activists is the crux of the matter. Is this not breach of trust? Is it not outright corruption? Imagine the howls of indignation and all the lawsuits that would have resulted if a federal party had paid millions in taxpayer fund to an activist group that had campaigned (and campaigned with extremely harsh and even false claims) for their party... The Liberals have admitted that this has been going on years. Will we get a final accounting of how long this has been on and exactly how much public money was given to the unions?"
8301,"In the 60's my professors taught that Canadians acquiring a liberal arts degree would help humanity progress towards the elimination of ignorance, indifference, war, poverty and hatred by making people more liberal in the best senses of the word, 'liberal' - enlightened, open-minded, generous, altruistic, unselfish, unafraid and magnanimous. Despite the proliferation of BA's and MA's - and despite the purportedly enlightening effect of extensive travel - none of these salutary changes have happened. Quite the contrary. I do believe, however, that the hearts and minds of my professors were in the right place. Clearly that cannot be said for certain powerful forces in the world who wanted people to remain ignorant, indifferent, afraid, hateful, selfish, miserable , narrow-minded and mean-spirited."
8945,"Trudeau and the Liberals have to remember that although 68% of voters voted against Steven Harper, 60.5% voted against Trudeau."
4163,"As a Trudeau supporter and card carrying member of the LPC I wholeheartedly support your need for child care. With a job like yours sir, not having child care would be neglect. All of the Conservative clapping seals who think that you and Sophie have the time to take care of your kids are fools. Do the right thing however and pay for it yourself."
8352,"This article shows a profound lack of research. As a female cyclist (who firmly feels that pink streamers would create unnecessary drag and really just get in the way), I think Ms. Wente needs to end her 30 year hiatus from cycling, and come and join us on the road. I firmly believe that once out there, she will realize that roads have changed. Getting to work with your makeup in tact and hair done-up are often secondary to getting to work feeling happy, healthy and energized, not to mention the joy that comes with avoiding road rage!"
7826,"More changing demands, now Spence is demanding that Stephen Harper sings I'm A Little Tea Pot or she is going to boycott her meeting."
545,"AN EXCELLENT ARTICLE & A MUST READ FOR ANY CONCERNED CITIZEN. I voted Conservative- NEVER AGAIN as scientists , our future in growth, are muted, mouth taped, or fired in their honesty. I have never said this & have never said it before BUT this ongoing, obvious muzzling is EXACTLY what happened in Hitler's Germany as he rose to power. Democracy is KILLED by this muffling & firings. Will I be visited by CSIS ???"
5836,couldn't happen to a more deserving person
8184,"What followed was a series of emails and moves to get Duffy out of the audit. The RCMP allege that Wright asked Gerstein to get in touch with a contact at Deloitte — a partner named Michael Runia — to see what was happening with the audit. In a March 1 email, Wright told Perrin that Gerstein’s actions were part of PMO work to get Deloitte to stop auditing Duffy. By March 8, Wright had decided to pay the Duffy expenses himself and told his assistant, Chris Woodcock, about his decision. “….For you only: I am personally covering Duffy’s $90K…” he emailed Woodcock. The RCMP say Wright didn’t tell Harper about the “minutiae” of Duffy’s repayment, but that Harper was kept apprised of problems with Duffy’s expenses as the controversy increasingly became a political headache. At one point in the documents, the RCMP quote from a May 14 email from Wright where he says: “The PM knows, in broad terms only, that I personally assisted Duffy when I was getting him to agree to the expenses.” It isn’t clear from the documents what “personally assisted” means in this specific context. The documents says the 2,600 emails the investigative team has reviewed suggest “the Prime Minister was informed by his staff that they were working on a plan to have Senator Duffy repay expenses,” a plan contingent on Duffy not losing his Senate seat."
9925,"If he resigned now, he do his party and the country a huge favour."
3410,"You ask , 'Will the demonization of Justin Trudeau succeed, as did similar campaigns against Stéphane Dion and Michael Ignatieff?'Are you serious? Dion and Ignatieff, like Trudeau, had this uncanny sense of 'foot in mouth disease,' at the most inopportune times. Conservative ads just reminded us. They did it to themselves. How come negative ads had so little effect on Jack Layton? Just made him more popular. Because he was much more experienced and sensible? Maybe?"
1899,Seems the G+M is lowering the standards it sets for columnists. This column is just embarrassing.
1041,"Hard to fathom this piece. Essentially, Mr. Harper is not a democrat. He really doesn't believe in democracy. He plays only to his base with the politics of fear and divisiveness. He could care less about those outside of his base. The worst myth about him is that he has managed the economy well. He blew the inherited surplus before the economic crisis hit and it was our stable banking system that got us through the crisis, not anything he did. He took the word 'progressive' out of his party's name. He should have replaced it with 'regressive.' Sadly, true conservatives have let their party be taken over by a bunch of reactionary ideologues from the Reform party. I'm a senior citizen and he's the worst PM of my lifetime. His legacy will be an absolutely empty one and history will not treat him well."
4704,the Globe editorial board should be ashamed of itself. Canada is more important than your pathetic support of the Harper government.
4689,"Globe lets any wingnut write columns, as in Gibson."
1317,"As a vast majority of comments here proves, the public is GETTING IT! The fire department has now realized they are becoming a huge expense to the taxpayers. So what do they do?? They attack EMS claiming now with their 8 weeks of total training (a small percentage in first aid) they can deliver a service superior to a paramedic with advanced medical training after graduatiing from at least a 2 year college course (some now with a degree in emergency medicine from U of T). Of course, and per usual, they cannot back any of their claims with evidence-based data or independent statistical data. They just say it is so so it must be so. Well, the informed, intelligent public aint drinkin' that Koolaid any longer. Thanks for an excellent article."
11378,"Diesel cars get mile mileage from a litre ... They have never been cleaner and never will be, you are using a product that is 1/2 refined compared to standard gasoline. Every process engineer in the world should know this. The real truth here is that no one properly educates themselves about anything to do with the Enviroment and emissions. It's so much easier to shut down a non emitting pipeline, or protest the oil sands, than actually educate yourself."
1066,"Calling Hillary Clinton, who is currently subject of at least one... if not more... criminal investigations by the FBI a 'slightly flawed' candidate is quite rich don't you think? Very little doubt that if elected, she'll be impeached in pretty short order, if not jailed for seriously jeopardizing national security. And that's without even completing the ongoing investigations on 'pay to play' allegations with respect to the Clinton Foundation. Let's be fair. Both Trump and Clinton are both seriously flawed candidates. Going to be fun to watch things play out after the election no matter which one of them wins."
85,"Its interesting that reader are allowed to post comment on this piece, yet comments were clossed on the op ed piece by the writer Mark Hayden on the same issue, in his newspaper, from a day or so earlier. What gives? A lawsuit? A desire to focus attention on the regular columnit piece... this one.....or to ensure there would be no commentary on the Hayden article. Which i thought was more than a bit sanctimonious in its attitude. Who are we to judge the ancestry of others.....while Mr.Boyden's actual specific links to his first nations heritage may not be as strong as for others, like Mr. Hayden.....i dont believe for a momen that Mr. Boyden doent have first nations culture in his heritage. And even if he did not , it doesnt take away his talent as a writer, which is based on imagination, talent with words and plot and narrative, with much research. Denying Mr. Boydens talent and the quality of his works is mean-spirited, just as is disparaging the works of Grey Owl and others.."
1330,"Under Harper, Canada was the only country where scientists had to ask for 'permission' to talk about the weather... Its attitude toward science was epitomized by Vic Toews. When asked how the Conservatives could justify the expenditure of millions of dollars for new prisons in the face of falling crime rates, he said: 'We don't care about scientific evidence, we do what we know is right.' Ideoligical fanatics, that's what conservatives are."
8613,How about a different stance Margaret. We could at least make realistic laws instead of either turning a blind eye or prosecuting some poor young goof that is suddenly thrust into a position he will live to regret. This along with abolishment of the Senate would be good work to embrace.
11427,"It would be helpful to have Naila Keleta-Mae or one of the leaders of BLM in Canada explain to us Canadians in detail why they seem to keep adopting practically the exact same agenda BLM has in the USA, and why they keep relying on US statistics. It is hard to take seriously the relevance (to the Canadian reality) of an article like this when all the author says about Canada is a) that what the Canadian tenors did was not acceptable, and b) that 'discussions about anti-black racism in the United States inform discussions about anti-black racism in Canada.'I lived in NYC for several years (in Harlem for a few years, to be precise), which helped me understand why the BLM movement is very necessary in the USA to change the unfair treatment African-Americans often receive from others - not only from white people, and not only from the judicial system. But although it's obviously true that there is racism in Canada, I would question whether BLM Canada has a strong case or whether the execution of their agenda is appropriate when they keep relying on statistics and examples of what happens in the USA. My intention is not to play down the importance of Black Lives Matter - I would simply like to see the Globe and Mail publish an article that focuses more on the Canadian reality beyond Margaret Wente's article on what BLM Toronto did during the Pride Parade. Maybe it is because the level of racism in Canada is not nearly as bad as it is in the USA that many Canadians do not see anything wrong, 'ignorant' or 'racist' in saying 'All Lives Matter'?"
189,"Not so long ago, virtually all women in their prime tended to home and family. The only exceptions were the infertile and the feeble-minded. Home-making was integral to what it was to be a woman, and not to be a home-maker was shameful. That’s no longer true. Today, a woman can choose any career or still be home-makers as a lifestyle as an option – and plenty do. They’re quite happy to be liberated from their traditional roles and join men in the workforce while still expecting men to fulfill their traditional roles of protector and provider and shaming them if they don't."
4582,"Apart from the sexist 'femme fatale' nonsense, I agree with Wente. However, there is much better take on the Adams issue by Andrew Coyne in Postmedia."
3573,"A complete joke. Cops and firefighters are greatly overpaid for the work they do, then retire on gigantic pensions. If this doe not stop, or at least slow down, it will bring us all to ruin very quickly."
10704,Spare me from Margaret Wente.
7475,"Good for you Ms. Wente. You are painting all seniors with the same brush, which is wrong. Many seniors are not well off, and must work past 60 and 65 just to survive. Death and Divorce happens, and it is a lot tougher on one income. You have just been fortunate and lucky."
10614,Bay Street experience does not necessarily assure economic creds. Joe Oliver is definitely a Bay Street man. He is not impressing. I am surprised that Lawrence Martin would see this as a problem.
3660,Most stupid editorial ever. Is this a real paper? Obviously not. Makes you wonder about other editorial decisions over the years.
5538,"Wow, one of the few thoughtful articles that I've seen on this issue of gender equality in cabinet. A journalist who had the nerve to thoughtfully challenge Trudeau's politically motivated diversity optic. Merit should be the main determinant of cabinet appointees in 2015."
8965,[Why is French immersion so popular?]To get to the other side.
9497,"We're all pretty sick of 'smart' people telling us they know what is better for us than we do ourselves. We get a lot of crap like that from the current Ontario government, for example, and their day of reckoning at the next election can't come soon enough for me."
6563,"Silly stuff, guys. You lost. get over it. Crapola in spades."
11169,"I expressed my feelings of exclusion to Erin O'Toole, Conservative defender of the anthem as is, and got this response:'I believe that you are the second person to have ever contacted me with respect to this issue and the feeling of exclusion. The first was earlier today when my comments were carried in a news story. This includes the hundreds of women I served with in the Canadian Armed Forces. My deep appreciation for heritage and symbols comes from that time. I spoke in the debate in the House tonight and there is no exclusion in the anthem. Anyone who has a glowing heart when it is sung or listened to is part of the Canadian family regardless of gender or background. We should not tinker with our symbols which are a reflection of our early years as a young country. If we were to re-write the song today I am sure a lot would be different, but that is the very point. Symbols and anthems don't get recast and redrafted with each generation.'I was very relieved to have the situation explained to me and the validity of my feelings denied. I will be sharing this article with Mr. O'Toole, who may have to explain things to Elizabeth as well, just so he know there are three us of who feel left out..."
2247,"The concern about affordability and keeping costs down is perfectly valid. However what a firefighter does in his spare time, fishing or otherwise, is none of anyone's business and is clearly hitting below the belt. I am happy firefighters are not putting out as many fires. Do you really want more fires to justify their wages - that would be ridiculous. I am happy that I don't have to use my life insurance or travel insurance after paying for it - and that is what fire safety is like. Go ahead with reasonable - and respectful - dialogue about cost cutting. Leave the snide remarks aside."
2495,"If in 50 years of stay in Canada, Sheema has not learnt to adapt herself to the minimum of the Canadian values, it only shows how non-adaptable the Muslims are. If nearly one million Canadian Muslims pile up all their grudges against Canada, as she has done, then it seems there is no remedy for their complaints. Sometimes, it seems Seema Khan and the Burqa lady from Pakistan have done great harm to the spirit of Canadian multiculturalism. Surely, there must be some Canadian Muslims around to restrain the self-appointed militant Sheema Khan, as a spokesperson for all Canadian Muslims, hailing from many parts of the world."
821,The US may well elect the quintessential Ugly American president. America is becoming a parody of its self-image.
776,"The fear-filled, ignorant, uninformed bigots are out in full force this beautiful morning. It is very discouraging Leitch's stinking dog whistle politics have a receptive audience who, unashamed, defend bigotry. Depressing."
9194,"Pierre Trudeau is not universally admired. Critics deemed his vision too centrist and his style too arrogant. Pirouettes behind the Queen were not cute, but condescending. Flipping his middle finger at voters in Salmon Arm was not irreverent, but insulting. Yes, Quebec remained in Canada during Trudeau’s tenure, but its nationalist forces grew in response to his intransigence, leading to the near loss of the 1995 Quebec referendum. And Western alienation established deep roots as a consequence of Trudeau’s National Energy Program. When Beaver Magazine (now Canada’s History) conducted an online poll in 2007 to name “Canada’s worst person,” after the 15,000 ballots were counted, Pierre Trudeau topped the list. http://www.orwelltoday.com/trudeaufinger.jpg"
9796,"Of course she needs two nannies - are you suggesting that the one nanny work well beyound a regular shift, who would look after the children when they attend functions in the evening, go on business trips etc."
1027,"Today's leader in the Globe is either deliberately misleading or, more charitably, poorly researched. Wearing the niqab is NOT mandated by Islam... just how many times does that have to be said? More tellingly women are FORBIDDEN to wear any face covering that clings to the face during the Hajj (the most sacred pilgrimage for any mus*lim). So in light of that why would some women embrace its use? Those of us who have lived and worked in the ME never saw women wearing niqabs.. most went bareheaded or wore the hijab (essentially a headscarf) and no one is quibbling about the use of the latter. What the Globe is failing to recognize is that wearing the niqab has nothing to do with being devout but everything to do with tyranny and misogyny and the sooner it is banned in Canada the better. For all those who argue that women want to wear this garment let us remind ourselves that women are complicit in the dreadful practice of female genital mutilation which is carried out by older women in the community. Brainwashing."
9897,Canada doesn't have a 'gun problem' - but the G&M has a desperate content problem !
11889,"There you go parents. You can be rest assured your aspiring journalistic offspring will receive a fine start to their careers by obtaining an impartial, unbiased and objective education from this professor."
6463,Because of course an academic setting (and a philosophy class no less!) is the perfect place to gauge peoples' ability to cope with day-to-day reality. What a nifty combination of self-promotion and semi-delusion - hopefully he'll get a high score on Rate-My-Prof! I wonder if his students will agree with his conclusions once they have to start paying back their student loans? I suspect the sudden shock of transitioning from classes to the workforce and finding out that people are no longer interested in your opinions once you're no longer paying them fees has not changed that much from Boomers to Gen X to Millennials.
7247,"Political commentary aside (and it's millenia, not milleniums, G&M editors), Ms. Wente's experience of being in Israel is very similar to mine when I went a couple of years ago. She captures the behaviour and attitude of the local Israelis very well. Also, having traveled a little bit in the Middle East, it is also perhaps the one country in which a Western woman can move about freely. I particularly appreciated that at the time, because I was travelling solo. She didn't say whether she met any Arab Israelis as well as Jewish ones, which you will, especially if you are in Jerusalem. It is here that the society bifurcates - the Jewish Israelis feel that they have been supportive and helpful and have given the Arab Israelis the tools to succeed. The latter of course feel discriminated against (not wholly unjustified because some Israeli companies will not hire them, claiming fear of terrorism).The political history there is very complicated, but there's no question that since 1948, the Israelis have created a jewel in the midst of the desert, and preserved the sanctity of the holy places that serve three religions. On the other hand, there is also no question that they are so heavily supported by the United States, that it's hard to say how much of all that development is really to their credit (and this is a big part of the problem for their neighbours). In the days of the cold war, when Israel was one of the U.S.'s few allies in that area, the support made some strategic sense. 20+ years after the end of that cold war, much less so."
3317,"The fleecing of the Canadian taxpayer began immediately last October as Justin and his corrupt group of incompetents scored a big win for themselves. Their self-entitlement is sickening. They better enjoy it, because in 4 years, they'll never be in power again. Justin is nothing but Wynne on a larger scale."

3581,"the issue is that conservatives are trying to pick on stupid stuff. Mr Harper had a house manager and a chef which was charged to taxpayers. give me a break, there is nothing excessive here, it's part of having the most important job in Canada."
10505,Thanks for bringing more light and perspective to this important issue... a joke that the BC premier sat on her duff while rome burned. Almost $3million for a detached in metro Vancouver is insane......Condo boards forgoing English and only willing to speak in Madarin also insane.
8676,get the muslim men to wear it if everyone is so hung up about modesty.. how come it is only the women who have the modesty concerns?
3919,"Dear Globe: nither did the Harper Government have a monopoly on Canadian values, by the way."
5898,Obama is like King Cnut trying to stop the waves...
4295,"Lousier week for Canadians because the decision to participate will likely imperil our safety. As usual, the mainstream media has failed us. This time by not challenging the government narrative about ISIS posing a serious threat to our national interests. If we're participating because ISIS kills people in heinous ways, why was there no similar outrage when Israel was recently killing Gazan children on an industrial scale? Why no outrage at Saudi Arabia which beheads people with regularity?"
3965,"Follow the advice of the editorial board here, and make it easier for Harper to resign by voting anything but Conservative."
6758,"He'll do well with the CP bully boys...(they'll impose a don't ask, don't tell, mind you, on him)"
1039,"The fact that the Trump phenomenon arose should tell the world, that 'Something is rotten in the state of Denmark' i.e. the US. Millions of Americans lean towards Trump to escape from the unsavoury status quo that Hillary Clinton represents. The US can't ignore the lack of trust toward Clinton. If she becomes the next president, she'd better clean up her act and stop thinking/behaving like a white collar criminal."
11929,"With these rules, America is in the same boat as the two other great democracies, Eritrea and Liberia."
1322,"I think of those poor Ukrainians described in this section on pages F6 and F7. How would people with real problems like that possibly relate to the preoccupations of our 'progressives'?One thing is certain: these so-called progressives control public opinion on everything from natural resource development (let's not) pipeline expansion (never) modern agriculture (no, organic is all we need) and so on.Continue on, Margaret, but dont expect to win your case."
2619,So now they will blame everyone but the person that had total control. Steven Harper. The others may have made suggestions but the final word was his and he blew it. His communication people were woefully short on communication skills.

248,"Deflections and obfuscation, that's what this article consists of. It's not about Monsef's actual place of birth. Rather it is a legitimate question - in light of mounting evidence - of whether she deliberately lied about her place of birth in order to perpetuate a specific narrative about her life and further her political ambitions. It is also a question of whether she deliberately lied about her place of birth while taking certain solemn oaths to this nation. The Obama birther issue is completely different because there never was any evidence to begin with that he was born somewhere other than Hawaii, so the 'birthers' were essentially just making accusations from thin air without merit. That is not the case with Monsef's critics."
628,Enough said both these canadites are a disaster it doesn't matter which one wins. God help the U.S. A. and for that matter the world.
2405,"Harper started deflecting from the real issues by divisive fear-politics and the niqab issue. He polarized Canada, pushing narrow self-interest; the past 2 weeks we erected Liberal signs along the road, and they were repeatedly vandalized, even shredded and run over by pick-up trucks veering off the road. Harper's followers shred democracy, validated by Harper's example. People dominated by fear will not be open to cooperation or come up with creative solutions; their minds are seized - 'hopefully' voting for Harper. On the economy; Harper inherited a 'sound ship' from the Liberals, and can only produce a meagre 'budget surplus' by increasing the national debt. As with national politics, Harper's foreign policies are confrontational. As a consequence, most talent has left the conservative party. It is time for Harper and the Conservatives to go."
3371,"I love this part:'Under the proposed law, CSIS agents will be allowed to take measures to reduce any perceived “threat to the security of Canada.” Agents will only need a warrant for activities that might contravene Charter rights or the law.'Um, say that again? If CSIS wants to violate Charter rights or other laws it will be able to get a warrant to do so? That's some pretty serious legislation Harper has planned for Canada."

The Democrats got in and increased spying on their own people, friendly nations, opposing politicians even more than the Republicans. SO really it's not a good comparison."
9458,"Apparently debilitating post traumatic stress is not considered a health problem by most of those commenting here.

11122,"Trump has been trolling and has succeed in making the media look foolish. Let's face it folks these newspaper or blogs or what ever will not be around much longer. Nobody wants to is paying for a wad of newsprint. We can see there are so many more talented journalists who have a voice on the internet or youtube who simply have not been hired in to the big medias oligarchy for one reason or another. You can see one journalist after another, these days, is melting and so bellow par compared to the new wave of independent journalists. Ask yourself could any of these journos make in the new media world of the internet? Trump has turned this paradigm shift into an opportunity.

3152,"The world will not be saved by renewable energy. The world will be saved by smart, computerized, energy management and higher energy efficiency. Electric (fully or hybrid) vehicles that charge at low-demand parts of the evening. Computers that take run at half the wattage of computers today. Computerized energy controllers that completely - COMPLETELY - cut phantom power losses by switching off devices when they are absolutely not in use (ie. late at night). Reduce your power requirements, and it doesn't really matter WHERE you get the power from, because the CO2 equivalent impact will be greatly reduced."
2071,"Chretien's comments are self-serving and a reflection of the drift during his tenure. He fails to mention he autorized NATO bombing in the former Yugoslavia without UN sanction nor his Iraqi poliy which came about after informing the US we were participating. What changed his calcusus was the pending Quebec provincial election where Canadian particpation in Iraqi was proving to be a liability for the provincial Liberals (and federalism) - so he jetisonned that policy. No high minded values or vision entered into the decision - it was crass local politics. Chretien also misses the point about leadership - leadership comes from prinicple and values - whether everyone thinks you are a nice guy is immaterial. His preoccupation with being a leader is all about image and gamesmanship. Afterall, Jean Chretien proclaimed that politics is just a game, of which he proudly declared himself as a master. His tenureship was marked with timidity, passivity and mediocrity. Harper has learned well from the master of the game."
1507,"Fifty years in Canada and its not the young Canadian men who planned to bomb Toronto that devastated you. Its a debate on the niqab that did you in. That speaks volumes.

However, it seems to deflect the responsibility of the PM himself in this situation and the editor is very cynical to suggest that the same immoral and irresponsible actions would befall any subsequent leader. That is a terrible suggestion and reflects badly on the Canadian electorate. I think we can do better! The Globe should do better as well."

2334,"The brutal authoritarianism we see in the Middle East is the product of combining religious, legislative, executive, judicial and educational authority in one body. The freedoms we enjoy in the West are not due to the fact we get to vote. Egypt elected the Muslim Brotherhood. Hardly a regime that championed freedom. We enjoy freedom when we place limits to the authority any person or body has by separating types of authority. None of Canada's major parties have identified separation of powers as an issue or value. If every local community understood the need for, and established and maintained separation of religious, executive, judicial, legislative and educational powers, groups like ISIS would not exist. I see a lot of irony in watching the Conservatives, Liberals and NDP debate Canada's involvement in Iraq when none of them support the separation of powers here in Canada. The only party that has the separation of religious, legislative and educational powers in its platform is the Freedom Party and they don't even hold one seat in our legislature. Don't we need to tend our own garden first?"

5257,"I'd turn it around and ask the question, why should he have an effectively lower salary as Prime Minister (by paying for a Nanny himself) just because he has young children?? Or, is being a Prime Minister a 'more intrusive' job than most others needing more support for things like family than other jobs? Or, if he was a female Prime Minister would anyone dare ask this same question? He isn't paid that much more than the President of a mid-sized Canadian university. And about the same as the Dean of Education at OISE. You could ask the question 'Is the Prime Minister of Canada' paid enough? Is the compensation for the job equivalent to that of CEOs of companies?"

9235,"I am married to a Belgian and I have spent a lot of time there both for pleasure and for work. I can say without question the place is one of the most racist countries I have come across. Because someone is a socialist, it doesn't make them benign or liberal for that matter. Unlike Canada or the UK where I lived along time or Hong Kong where I currently live, you rarely come across someone who is Flemish or Wallon that has a friend who is not from their own community. It is a very very provocial place which is partly explaied by the fact that everyone is still living in the same village of their ancestors. When my wife's uncle did the family tree, he traced it back to the 16th century and everyone (with the exception of one Dutchman) was from 4 or 5 villages all within walking distance of each other (albeit it could be an hour or two by foot). That is the norm. It also means that people speak radically different dialects within 5 minutes car ride from each other. My wife's family is from the east and they can barely understand the people from the west of the country which is a little over an hour car drive away. The place is very fragmented which contributes to the lack of national identity (which is mostly caused by the French and Dutch divide). But it's kept that way as unlike most countries where the march to the cities drove a national identity by stamping out regional differences or at least muting them, Belgian is so small that people just stay in their villages and commute to work in Brussels or Antwerp or frankly pretty much anywhere from there. It's great in a way as you keep your family and friends but it also means you are not willing to make new ones. So Margaret's article is complete rubbish. Belgian is completely about exclusion and isolation. It is not a mosaic or melting pot of different nationalities. It's a fragmented country of tiny communities all speaking different dialects and very distrusting of each other, no matter foreigners."

Americans on a one by one basis are very nice people but the society they have created is not to be envied. The one thing the US is good for is relatively cheap, warm places to go in the winter, but you wouldn't want to live in those places in the summer. All the top ten or twenty countries are all pretty good places to live, but with the usual caveat; you make your life what it is, happy or sad, good or bad no matter where you live."

Let us now hope he learns to lead and not bully, learns to be president not a small time partisan boss, and let us hope he does make America great again. Lets hope he changes his methods for the greater good of all."

On this point, Mr. Mulroney was not afraid to stand up to Margaret Thatcher and our close ally, Britain. He rightly saw that they were wrong.--And what was Harper doing at the time? Cheering Mulroney on? Otherwise supporting the fight against Apartheid? No - he was disgracing himself by taking up membership in the racist Northern Foundation."

I pray that his life matters as much as would mine should he ever encounter a police officer on the way home from the convenience store as a teenager.

1073,"The 'systematic and uncompromising respect for a certain type of liberal discourse' that professor French mentions is not what is at issue with Flanagan's comments. Flanagan showed himself to be entirely unknowledgeable about a subject he wished to discuss: viewing child pornography is not a victimless crime. As Mr. Flanagan was unable to recognize this most basic of facts, blinded by his libertarian ideology, he emphatically proved what many began to realize after he publicly called for the assassination of Assange: his desire to shock had overtaken his desire to have a serious discussion. Flanagan likely became an embarrassment to the University of Calgary and so, as any employer is free to do, they rid their balance sheet of a liability. This is not a case of 'self-censorship which guarantees the hegemony of values now in vogue' as Professor French contends, it is a case of a public individual being held accountable by his employers for making outrageous, ignorant, and just plain bizarre statements."
10193,"Management and unions: Best solution: Management that understands the value of good employees, no union necessary. 2nd best solution: Management counter-balanced by a union that understands the value of good people, not just seniority. 3rd best solution: Aggressive management that doesn't care about people, counter-balanced by an aggressive union that doesn't care about employees' performance, that rewards seniority over performance, that allows senior employees to have completely different pay and benefits packages than new employees. Bad solution: Aggressive management threatens to outsource jobs unless unreasonable concessions in pay are made, sometimes in spite of assurances made to employees and government. Another bad solution: Bureaucrats managing money and employees that isn't theirs and that they don't really care about, and public sector unions that demand not just job security, but more pay and benefits than the private sector receives, year after year. Very bad solution: The above, and government is unduly influenced by the public unions in elections, and unions are rewarded for campaign donations and get-out-the-vote support with raises far above the private sectors, with secretive and unregulated pension top-ups, etc. The absolutely worst solution, Ontario's nightware: the above, plus the province is running $15-20 billion deficits for four years running thanks in part to billions thrown away in diverse scandals, debt has doubled in under ten years, debt-to-GDP has gone up from 28% to 40+%, salaries in the private sector are stagnant or decreasing, but after a decade of extremely generous raises and unbelievable benefits, huge pensions, iron-clad job security, expansion of teachers' unions despite declining school enrollment, even early retirement for some, militant unions still demand far more than the province can pay, and go on and on about 'rights' and 'democracy' when they don't get their way, threaten to strike illegally, disrupt parents' lives and sabotage kids' education by forbidding teachers to do extracurriculars. The teachers of our kids support such a union overwhelmingly."
4142,"Very good analysis. Very well said.'There are good reasons not to leave culture, education, lifestyles or jobs completely exposed to the creative destruction of market forces.'Harper is quoted as saying, 'You won't recognize Canada when I'm finished with it.' Not to mention Harper's secret dismantling of democracy and his far right foreign policies, the tsunami of immigrants has accomplished Harper's mission. While some immigration is to expected, burying native Canadian left-of-centre values under a deluge of middle class immigrants from war torn right wing nations is wrong for those impoverished countries that desperately need all the educated professionals they can get; and its wrong for millions of Canadians who find their wages stagnant, competing with Third World professionals for scarce good-paying jobs and shortage of housing. Most of all, the cutthroat global economy with it's dog-eat-dog value system, has changed the character of Canadians. Compared to 1985, pushed by educated, qualified resentful immigrants, Canadians are much more aggressive, arrogant, self-centred, indifferent, inner-directed, and separate; much less friendly, compassionate, helpful, generous, and community-spirited."

Placebo is an interesting concept. Pills are a placebo. Not just pills of a particular chemical but ANYTHING in pill form is more effective than in non pill form according to the placebo effect. Calling pot 'not medicine' is illogical. Thalidomide is medicine. It's also poison. But they keep coming up with new uses for it. And its a chemical that changes your body. You can say it's 'bad' medicine, like Thalidomide for morning sickness was - because it doesn't work as intended (But there is a factor of that in ALL drugs). But it's still medicine. The only real argument to classify it as 'NOT' medicine is to say it's so ubiquitous that it's like alcohol, caffeine or possibly nicotine (debatable, as nicotine becomes less common). That we use it so often recreationally that it is no longer for medicinal or therapeutic purpose. Like food - a chemical that changes your body but is not medicine. In any case it's all semantics and Margaret's point made here is quite trivial - it doesn't support the broad conclusions applied to government policy."
4814,What a surprise.
11164,"While I largely agree 'Bob from Calgary', it is more complex than he states because Canada has been an under-achiever.Take infrastructure. Canadians place too much emphasis on it and we have a long history of white elephants that wasted capital - such as canals in the 1840s and then having 3 transcontinental railways just prior to WW1. Projects like the St. Lawrence Seaway never lived up to their billing, and look at the foolishness of the SkyDome's construction cost. Meanwhile, we have had a massive influx of immigrants into Toronto and Vancouver, yet have not been willing to pay for the infrastructure needed to prevent congestion from becoming a major problem. Canada has the highest percentage of citizens with post-secondary education in the OECD, yet we have high unemployment, underemployment, low productivity growth and stagnant wages, all signs of a surplus of labour. Yet we still justify high immigration because of supposed skill shortages and fears of future labour shortages. Canada should be the richest and most prosperous country on the planet, rather than one with a 72 cent dollar because we are too dependent on resources, have too much foreign investment and control of our economy. Our success is mostly due to luck, not because of strategy or planning or making sacrifices. Just compare the economic progress of Canada to South Korea over the last 50 years - in 1965, who would have thought that Canadians would be buying Korean cars, instead of the other way around. Rather than doubling down on our traits of investing in infrastructure and education, we need to be doing a wide range of things a lot smarter, and be a little less smug."

254,"My Father was in the WW2 with some Indians friends (I try not to use the I word anymore). Our family leasedland on their reserve and built a cottage. Our parents are gone but we're still there. We have a few years left on a 50 year lease which we a trying to extend. We leased the land off an individual not the band. We have alwaysbeen treated fairly. I find most of the comments here, either outright racist or with a hidden racist undertone. Most of the commenters only see the radical element, not the underlying quality and warmth of the people. I find that Native people are like a huge family united in a mutual struggle; Grievances are a by-product.Although there are two groups on the reserve: Native and Non-Native; there is a lot less racism than you wouldassume. On this reserve many Non-Natives are family members. The most racist people I have encountered on this reserve were visitors who abused the hospitality they were so graciously given."
10272,"So you got rid of your doctor, not because he was incompetent, but because his religious beliefs made you uncomfortable. Have you tried to fire any interns at your office for the same reason? I'm no lawyer, but it sounds to me like your doctor has been discriminated against solely on the basis of his religion. You are sure that everyone will agree that you did the right thing? Wrong. I think what you did was as bad as deciding to fire someone because their veil makes you uncomfortable. Worse, you make it clear that you believe religious belief is a bad thing. You rejoice in the fact that far fewer Canadians identify themselves with any religion, without any explanation as to why that would, in and of itself, be a good thing. I am not an overly religious person, but I think everyone should have the right to practice their religion as they see fit, as long as it doesn't impinge on my right to think and believe differently. In an open and progressive society, there will be grey areas that need tending to, and that is supposed to be the topic of lively discussion, but if I had done what you did, I would be ashamed of myself for not being able to get over my discomfort with my doctor's 'differentness'.Finally, to answer your question, 'who wants a doctor whose faith resides in anything other than medicine?', I do, for one. Medicine has come very far in the last hundred years, but had you been born 100 years ago, your faith in medicine would quite simply have been misplaced. In 100 years from now, who knows what medical 'truths' will be thought of as quaint, antiquated misunderstandings? I don't want a doctor who believes that his or her current knowledge of medicine is everything that will ever need to be known. Do you?"

I'm sick of the philanthropic nobles who protest that the mass exodus of Syrian people is a virtuous cause. Everyone wants to get a pat on the back for being the progressive 'inclusionist' but there is something fundamentally more distinct to this group that makes it much more difficult to integrate than many other third world cultures. Time will show that this was a short sighted and ill conceived idealist move with consequences and difficulties that will affect these countries for a long time. The real problem is that 'integration' is nearly impossible with the numbers we're talking about. They'll establish themselves in large communities which will increase the divide and resentment between local and foreign culture. At the moment 11.3 men to one female are flowing across the borders. They will survive in groups, and gang mentality will thrive further inhibiting this idea of Syrian integration. The problems continue from there, however this article shed some light on a conversation too many are afraid to have. I don't know why I chose your post to blurt this out, but having been sick and tired of the ongoing issues, I think it's time we wake up and find a real solution to this problem. Look what happened to the Somalian refugee program of the early 90's.

But after that editorial debacle last week, I have found my thinking has shifted to, 'I don't really trust them as much now. Their thinking really is unjustifiably biased to favour the Conservatives' (I know it is a Conservative paper, I just thought they had the ability to be more impartial with their readers than other papers - naïve, I know now, I know). To come out in support of the party whom they wrote 5 'Kill the Bill' editorials about last year is too sad to be laughable, but rather willfully, and dangerously blind: I don't trust them to advise me anymore. So, I will read the G&M less, trust them less, and let my subscription lapse when it ends,"

'I'm just not politically correct' makes it acceptable for someone like Trump to play to the simple minded's wont to blame all of their problems on immigrants, minorities, and others they feel are somehow different. The right wing's use of this excuse for spreading hate has been seen before in history and it has produced horrendous results. It's time to be truly politically incorrect and label what people like Trump are saying as what it is: bigotry, racism, misogyny, and hate. In Canada we have free speech, but we don't allow the promotion of hatred of other people. Right-wing 'thinkers' can't seem to understand this."
8321,"There is a widespread (and mistaken) belief that the top 1% of income earners are all 'wealthy', even though nothing could be further from the truth. It's not at all unusual for high income earners to have little to no net worth, thanks to their high debt loads. Also, most of these high income earners derive most of their income from salaries and do not have enough invested wealth to be able to retire in comfort. And even among those who own businesses and are among the highest 1% of income earners, most could not afford to play golf for the rest of their lives. In fact, there aren't that many people in this country who can be classified as truly 'wealthy' - ie. at least $5 million in invested wealth, although many would set the threshold much higher than that these days. Unfortunately, most of our Liberal and NDP politicians are more interested in pandering to the lowest common denominator than seeking to govern based on facts and common sense."

And while Harper and Mulcair played their tired old politics, Justin Trudeau was the only one to present a plan to invest in Canadians and grow our economy. I know what it’s like to go into an election underestimated. Like Justin Trudeau, I have been the target of baseless, mean-spirited attacks when Liberals dared to build a better country. When I was first elected in 1963, we did not have medicare. We did not have the Canada Pension Plan. We did not have our own flag. We did not have a Charter of Rights and Freedoms. And by the time I retired in 2003, we had come a long way: Medicare, CPP, a flag, our own Constitution, our place in the world. It was our Liberal Government that stayed out of the War in Iraq, signed the Kyoto Protocol, and balanced the budget 7 times in a row. Unlike the other parties, Liberals are fiscally responsible and socially aware. We accomplished great things together – because we too believed that a better Canada is always possible. And with you standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him, Justin Trudeau will do the same. There’s a long road ahead until October 19. There will be ups and downs. But I can tell you to never forget this one thing: Justin Trudeau is ready to lead. Help us put the torch of progress and hope, abandoned by this tired old Conservative government, back into Canadians’ hands. Jean Chrétien--- Jean Chrétien is absolutely correct... What we Liberals have to do to bring Canada back to the country it was before Harper, with the direct help of the NDP, stole Canada from Canadians and proceeded to destroy the wonderful way of life and justifiable pride we Canadians were justified in having for our great country of Canada... We Liberals especially will have to step up and stand up for Canada in this election with our money and our time to help our local Liberal Candidates make it over the top in every one of the 338 Canadian Electoral Districts... With a TEAM of absolutely the best Candidates ever to be assembled by any political party in Canada to run for Parliament how can we not? With the Liberals being the only Federal Party to have their focus on making all Canadians' lives better via the clear and purposeful Liberal Policies and Platform being presented (better is always possible as Justin Trudeau constantly reminds us) by Justin Trudeau and his TEAM... How can we not actively go about sharing them directly with all our fellow Canadians? How can we liberals allow the selfish, and totally misguided, focus of winning seats in Parliament to rule over Canadians for the next few years, no matter how bad, hurtful, and untruthful, the empty platform promises Harper and Mulcair and their 'Parties of One' are trying to push down the throats of Canadians without doing all we can to prevent that from happening again just as it did in 2011?

Then the propagandist must suggest a course of action that appears to deal with the new emotional issue instead of the real factual issue. Regarding the issue of the right to own a gun there are several facts. 1. Only gun ownership enables everyone, even the weak, to defend themselves. 2. Only gun ownership enables the forming of militias. 3. Criminals prefer guns in the commission of crime. The emotion is the outrage that results when thre are innocent victims of crime. At this point a rational person would want to determine if the criminal preference to use guns outweighs the honest persons desire to defend himself and form a militia when required. So folks remember, misinformation and emotional reaction is manipulation by propaganda. The only defence we have against being manipulated by propaganda is to value the facts when framing the issue and scrutinize every argument rejecting those that are not based on facts."
7430,"This is truly much ado about nothing.

Stop calling me a senior!'Then stop acting like a caricature of one."

House equity isn't realized until the property sells. And there is a housing correction coming. She also ignores disappearing pensions, and rising unemployment. We also know that real income figures (supposedly nominal income adjusted for inflation via the CPI), don't account for the cost of food or energy. It is a bogus figure to adjust by, invented to make nations look good on paper."

DDT, butter versus margarine, oil was running out in 1973, the sugar scare every few years, caffeine is bad for our hearts, and yes, the coming ice age was still taught in the seventies. Then we are told that the prairies were covered by ice not so long ago - what caused the warming that removed the ice? Climate changes is a fact that few deny; the cause is not understood. Making one side a religion with power to end careers and levy taxes makes me wonder about its honesty."

7495,"The problem is we are living in a stupid city (and province) filled with stupid people. Winnipeg (and Manitoba) faced flooding problems and spent $63 million in the 1960's (like close to a billion dollars today) to build Red River Floodway. Conservative estimates state it has saved over $30 billion in damages. They expanded the flood protection in the past few years at a cost of more than $665 million. This was spent by a province with a population less than a tenth the size of Ontario. Manitoba likewise invested billions in hydro electricity giving it clean power which generates revenue for export instead of the huge debt generated by the Ontario Hydro companies. Some provinces invest intelligently in infrastructure and others make stupid decisions. People in Ontario don't value quality infrastructure and services or they would demand it and be prepared to pay for it. This is why Ontario has rotting infrastructure. In Ontario, there is always lots of money for fraud and corruption as witnessed by the many scandals in the City of Toronto and Province of Ontario. This money could have been used to solve the infrastructure problems. Instead too much was wasted on pointless green energy initiatives that onlly made things worse. You can never solve a problem until you first acknowledge it exists. Toronto's arrogance will never acknowledge its total incompetence to deal with this enormous problem."
5320,"I think even Simpson had an article some time ago, how the 'Sunshine' lists actually work perversely...

3302,"Yes Harper must go.My problem with Harper is not economics. I disagree with him big time in foreign policy, foreign military intervention, security policy (C-51). I reject TPP but I blame him for failing to finalize and rectify the trade agreement with the EU. He has exposed himself as a Christian evangelical warmonger, tied this to Canada foreign and military policies, and arrogant enough to think his personal view must be that of the country. Given majority Harper proceeded to run the show all by himself, corrupt the Senate, and got corrupted by power. He forgot to work for the people. Time to exit. But Harper is still right on Trudeau - a pretty face who has learned to talk on the campaign trail. He is nowhere ready to deal with difficulties, run anything less a government. He exemplifies 'talk is cheap'. His Liberal is become socialist welfare and going into deep debt - two big policy loser. Mulcair NDP has assumed the centralist economic policies, and will re-establish Canada proven foreign and military policies. Mulcair has been responsible as Official Opposition. He will get my vote for a chance for government."

So much for German Engineering. What a great many people don't understand is that there is a LIMIT to the physics of it all. It's all well and good to legislate certain fuel economy, or certain pollution levels, but didja ever think that it may not be possible given the physics behind the internal combustion engine? It's all well and good to say cars need to get 100 MPG, but the law of conservation of energy, and pile of thermodynamics may just get in your way at some point"
6423,"Thank you Ms. Wente for adding some much needed insight into the Brexitcoverage in this paper. I disagree with you, however, that the 'Leave' vote was a negative outcome. On the contrary I hope it will open up for many other present EU member statesto follow in their lead. Being a member of the undemocratic EU costs a prettypenny and this expense is something no Brit will miss. The idea that it is only the ultra right that have desire to leave several of otherEuropean countries is just hogwash. As little as it was true that UKIP on it's owncould have brought the 'Leave' about."

7269,"Another thing is lower turnout doesn't necessarily mean parties right of centre cannot win. It does however mean they will have to have a broader appeal and certainly the Harper based Conservatives likely won't do this. In Australia, they've had plenty of conservative governments and they have mandatory voting. But since the Liberals (who are really conservative in Australia) rarely get over 50% on the first ballot, they have to appeal to people's second choices. In Germany and France, turnout usually exceeds 80% yet the CDU/CSU in Germany and UMP in France have a better winning record than the Conservatives in Canada. The difference is in Germany, usually it involves forming coalition so they have to be willing to cooperate with others while in France it goes to run off so much like Australia they have to appeal as second choice of others. Heck here in Canada, turnout is usually over 70% in the Maritimes where PC party often wins or in the last Saskatchewan election it was 70% where the Saskatchewan Party led by Brad Wall won a record 64% (note Harper's support in Saskatchewan has ranged for a low of 42% in 2004 to a high of 56% in 2011).The difference is the PCs in Atlantic Canada are mostly Red Tories who appeal to a larger segment and likewise Brad Wall maybe centre-right, but he is not a divisive type who hates anyone who disagrees with him like Harper. Its true in the US, the GOP benefits from lower turnout, but that's because their policies are to the right of many and since the demographics most likely to vote GOP are more likely to show up, they figure a lower turnout benefits them. This is the path the Conservatives seem to want to follow and is a bad choice in my view. They should find ways to appeal to a broader demographic not suppress turnout on the basis their base is more likely to show up than other party's."
7032,"Hello again, Thank you for the clarification. I appreciate the accurate information. Subject to further appeal, (if that happens, and for the time being) the disputed section of the 'Act' - and the 'Act' itself - remains 'constitutional' and the law of the land. So, 140, 000 (I think that is the number) ex-pat citizens have been denied their right to vote in this election for ideological reasons that I would like to know more about. They had this right in the last election, and for some reason that I cannot fathom (maybe it is just because the Harper gov't says so) now they do not. As democracy depends on fair elections . . . and Harper tends to use every trick in the book - he cheats especially with taxpayer's money - to tip the balance in his favour, once again the Charter is being attacked and subverted. Why do Conservatives hate the Charter so much? Why don' t Conservatives want ex-pats to vote so much that they change the rules so that they cannot? What are their reasons . . . . ?I'd like to hear about that in Court."

4123,"I have been criticized for suggesting that the young man killed was suffering from mental illness. I would ask anyone if his behaviour did not display some sort of melt down, whether this was done with pharmacutical assistance the autopsy will provide those kinds of details. But one can draw certain conclusions that so called 'normal' people do not go around pulling out knives. Mental illness is the biggest social issue we are facing today. Unfortunately we are not serving those who are in need. I can say from personal experience that any one who has to deal with social agencies gets sent in circles and all we get for answers are excuses. The police are not trained to deal with those suffering from any form of mental illness. They are trained to shoot to kill. We have abandoned those in need and left the decision making process up to the cops with deadly outcomes. The solution goes beyond any discussion here but if Chief Blair really wants to show leadership here's a good place to start."

10050,"Notwithstanding the graphic, this editorial disingenuously fails to mention the obvious: Any party will be able to do this. This means the cons can use footage of Harper in a father-ish blue sweater. The Liberals can produce photo essays of Jr. taking selfies with his admirers. And the NDP can have a field day producing posters of Mulcair thoughtfully stroking his beard, (assuming the media actually takes footage of Mulcair).I've noticed the Liberals supporters seem to be most upset about this. Is it because their leader is the most gaffe prone of the three?"
7377,Trump is just saying what is on everyones mind. The lamestream media and critics such as this are only making him stronger the harder they attack him.

That Hindus killed thousands of Muslims in India, that secularists of all stripes also have engaged in wars, mass murder and other atrocities? That Americans and yes even a couple of Canadian boys committed horrible acts during the wars in the Middle East? Those who convince themselves that Islam is the root of all evil are either blind, stupid or ill-informed, perhaps all. For more on moderate Islam, see Azza Radwan Sedky's book Cairo Rewind: The First Two Years of Egypt's Revolution, 2011-2013.

6205,"Good lord, this paper (and many others) need to sort their press freedom out. You can't have the whole staff get behind one candidate during the campaign only to be over-ruled by the owners for the endorsement and then shamelessly back-track when it doesn't go their way. These papers need their freedom away from the owners because it is really confusing to the electorate when you see the staff go one way and the editorial the other. If this continues to happen we just have to learn to ignore the endorsements because they are just the selfish whims of the owners who want to see the party that benefits their bottom line win by trying to convince the public in bad faith to vote against their interests."

Baird is a simple minded blowhard who reorganized our foreign aid to tie it to business interests.

So Baird will become a richer man and remain a shallow one.

It would not be going too far to say that at times Baird did not appear to understand who he was supposed to be representing as he divulged Canadian trade strategy to the Chinese Ambassador. And now we find Baird leaving office quickly and soon after starts working for a giant Hong Kong-based firm with strong political connections to China as an 'advisor'. Those discussions to secure that position no doubt happened quite a while ago....how far back I think we should know. Turns my stomach to hear this news.

Hillary has worked in government for many years, but her 'experience' is hardly praiseworthy. (ISIS and Benghazi being two examples of complete failure.).

And the farther away one gets from the urban centres, the less relevant Mr Simpson's bleating becomes.

Over the past two decades just about anything that can be produced and any service that can be provided in low wage countries has moved there, taking manufacturing and service jobs away. Then the TFW began bringing in people to keep wages down in whatever jobs can’t be performed outside the country – another aspect of globalization. You can bet the Harper government wouldn’t have acted on that if the media hadn’t exposed it. However globalization is a bonus for the owners of the companies who are able to keep their costs low while their profits soar, so they are happy to see the immigration debate framed in terms of racism."

While the US government lectured on human rights they were a state sponsor of terrorist attacks on Cuba. They trained terrorists Orlando Bosch and Luis Posada Carriles who bombed a Cuban airliner killing 73 people in 1976. Posada went on to plan a series of hotel bombings in Cuba in 1997 one of which killed an Italian tourist.

Old science is being disregarded in place of new 'gender science', a science that is frequently reported as 'in its infancy' and it seems rather presumptuous and irresponsible of our government to form legislation on scientific evidence that is so thoroughly inconclusive. That's putting the horse before the cart and it is a fundamentally flawed methodology.

5254,"It is absolutely amazing how the Cons can spin. Most of our deficits were accumulated during Con regimes, under B.M. the P.M. and Fascist Harper. These are the facts as they show up. Under Trudeau indeed deficits were part of the program but for every deficit dollar, there was a corporate deferred tax dollar. Under B.M. the P.M. laws and regulations were modified to allow corporations to sell these deferred tax dollars to corporations that needed credits in order to avoid paying taxes, a new market product that had not been allowed previously. Consequently our debt and the incurring deficits brought about by B.M.'s corporate tax gifts reduced revenues that caused massive accumulations of debt. The subsequent Liberals worked to reduce the accumulation of debt through measures that are derided by the Cons (strange but they never quite reversed all of these supposedly nefarious measures). The Harper regime then reduced the GST causing the disappearance of the 13 Billion surplus and the accumulation of an additional 160 or so billion dollars. For those Con artists (including Manning) the actual Liberal government is planning to spend no more that the previous Con regime accumulating debt at approximately the same previous regime rate while mandating that expenditures are more meaningful that the financing of arenas and club houses in Con ridings. Let meaningful infrastructure spending go ahead while the Cons will continue to Con."

5390,"Ms. Wente is a perfect object lesson in the kind of ignorant ideologue she claims to detest. This column of wrong-headed analysis, partisan smears, misplaced analogies, faulty parallelism and completely unsupported assertions claims to alert us to the danger of progressive ideologues, but actually demonstrates the danger of blinkered right-wing ideologues like herself. It is difficult to count the cost of misinforming the public, obscuring the facts or effectively preventing reasoned discussion, but it has been enormous. There are, in fact, rational arguments for right-wing positions. They may not be popular, but they are still rational. Instead we are treated to more of the same noxious advancement of false narratives, as if those with right wing views like Ms. Wente hold them only out of prejudice or ignorance. Or both."

1061,"The comment section for this article so far is hilarious - full of perfect examples of the hysteria Yakabuski is writing about. The Liberal and NDP long ago descended into a sort of 'boogy-man' politics that belies their noble self-image, and kudos to Yakabuski for pointing this out. The bottom line for this voter is that Trudeau is only the Liberal candidate because of his last name and is no way qualified to run our country, and the NDP is the repository of all of the goofball ideas generated by the army of academics who live in a bubble. The best example is proportional representation, which would give the tiniest fringe parties the swing vote and condemn Canada to political gridlock. The amount of money involved in the Duffy scandal is a fraction of the money the NDP improperly distributed to their constituency offices, and the 'scandal' involved a scheme to pay money BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS! But it is remarkable how much mileage the Liberals and NDP have gotten out of their 'chicken little' fear tactics. The fact that the Liberals would even run an empty cereal box like Trudeau shows us how dumb they think we are."

During and after the Reformation era many religious sectarians emigrated to the USA - and it shows ... Most emigration to North America from Europe went to the USA - Canada was merely an entry point and inconvenience to get to the States. Personally - I find them a great people and not quite as self righteous as ourselves, their pedestal isn't quite as high. The USA was the major contributor to the Allies victories in both WW1 and WW2 - their sheer industrial mass production and logistics tipped the balance.

9403,"After the last election, I predicted that the federal Liberal Party would decline to minor party status, much like what happened to the Liberal Part in Britain. Although the circumstances surrounding the decline of our Liberal Party are not the same as the ones that led to the decline of their British counterparts (the latter went through a disastrous split in the 1920s), its steady decline under a series of weak leaders since the 2006 election leaves it with not much of a future. Justin Trudeau is the wrong man to save the party, which would have had a much better chance of revival under Marc Garneau."

If he or she has small children, we can only have that accessibility if child care is immediately available. We have no right to ask the PM to have a spouse, or for a spouse to be in the home every minute of every day. Therefore, live-in, 24 hour child care is a must, and we should pay. This is not a Justin Trudeau issue, it is a PM issue that needs to be updated."

However, computers do not necessarily add to survival. This means that a nation with a lot of computers does not necessarily have any survival advantages. What computers can do is make the world paperless, make commuting obsolete (reducing the need for constant infrastructure replacement), make knowledge accessible to a larger body of people, and make governments more accountable, and greatly reduce our dependency on non-renewable resources. But in the hands of the anal-retentive, computers only create redundancies in businesses destined to go bankrupt."
134,"The Liberals have come and gone in the public affection before. But I agree with Jeffrey that it is now different. Before, while the public might have accepted or rejected Liberal policies, at least the party had credibility. People might have rejected the Liberals at particular elections, but there was always the thought that they could be gone back to if the new people weren't up to the task. This credibility has now been lost (probably irrevocably) as a result of their numerous squandered chances, bad decisions, lack of policy and commitment, and weak leaders. At one time, we had parties with identifiable differences--the left, the right and the centre. The left and the right made good protest votes (and some would vote for them out of reflex or inability to think things through), but Canadians being what they are, the centre was the best long term bet for a lot of people. But now the centre doesn't hold much appeal. It means nothing and stands for nothing. The country has become polarized between the right and the left, and increasingly people are willing to take a stand rather than voting for the party that offers the least contentious choice. I have been a lifelong Liberal supporter, but cannot see myself ever voting for them again. The choice is between the NDP and the Cons."

After hearing over and over of the deaths that have occurred this summer, it is difficult to believe that anyone is unaware that Europe is facing a crisis, and that there have been many deaths, including children. Showing a picture of a dead child seems to me to be more about selling newspapers. It is not too much to ask that a reputable news organization show some discretion in where such pictures are displayed."

Now we have the good news from the IPCC themselves of no warming in 15 years and what do you remaining believers do? You still want to believe in this misery for billions of helpless children. And doesn't the obvious epic failure of CO2 science clearly show that our children are not doomed to a CO2 death after all in planetary climate crisis?

Result is that the near trillion in evaded taxes over a 10 year period is in reality the driver of needed revenue to diminish U.S debt levels. GE for example in US pays no fed taxes. We also have seen reports on the 60 remote off-shore havens to hide corporate and individual profits without taxes levied and the total = 20 to 27 TRILLION USD$ not taxed. It is the little people (99%) who pay while oligarchs escape a criminal hoist."

Lawrence why don't you talk about the real problem with the economy in Canada. That would be a huge drop in the resource economy and the complete meltdown of the economy in Ontario manufacturing sector. Now one can blame Harper. If you look at it honestly the names to blame are Suzuki McGuinty and Wynne the Pooh. Not necessarily in that order. They have presided over a train wreck of real dumb energy policy with huge deficits and job killing policies. The pension plan to be just another cash grab and job killing policy. When the driver of your country decides to go in the ditch not much a PM can do about it but stand by and watch the crash. Can't wait for your next column LM on how Jr is coming into his own.

The union insists on process not arbitrary subjective removal. If you want USA results then start using their ways of doing things

4177,"He may well turn out to be reckless but recent history suggests that honour is better ascribed to Others:- Bill Clinton who paved the way for the takover of government by corporations through deregulation, - George Bush who allowed 911 to happen through sheer incompetence and then caused te jaw-dropping instability we're seeing in the ME by attacking destroying Iraq that had no WMDs and - Barrack Obama who gave his then Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, free reign to destroy Libya (which opened the refugees flood gates to Europe and the transfer of mercenaries and weapons to Syria) and orchestrate the overthrow of the legal government in Ukraine (which set the US on a war path with Russia)."
4307,"Canada has medicare and a better social security safety net. But before we get callouses from patting ourselves on the back, it is important to remember one thing. The U.S. spends a far greater percentage of its GDP on the military than we do and, because we live next door, the U.S. military protects the neighborhood and we benefit from that. We can and do divert financial resources away from our military to other matters. I do not disagree with the policy, I just think that Canadians should acknowledge that we have more flexibility in allocating budget resources to non-military issues than our friends to the south."

5019,Good god. Has the G&M really sunk so low. Just how is this now a pressing issue? Is it because you endorsed Harper once again so long as he resigned immediately? Yes. I agree that Trudeau should pay for his nannies. But have you been following the news? November had been an incredibly challenging month even for seasoned leaders. Do you not think that we could encourage Trudeau to do his best for our country? Frankly the editorials of the G&M seem inconsistent. Blowing hot and cold. Playing in the big leagues and the playpen alternatively. Is there someone in charge? Is there a thinking aldult guiding the ship?
2316,"You argue that we do not know what will happen if we legalise dope, but we certainly DO know what is happening right now while it is illegal. 20,000 to 40,000 people are arrested and charged with posession every single year. Those peoples future employment opportunities are permanenetly blighted. They have to waste many thousands of dollars going to court. They will have lots of troubles trying to cross borders. All that for no good reason at all, except that people like Wente want more people put in prison for whatever reasons. I suggest that since nobody has clear evidence about rates of use, tax levels, and costs, but we certainly DO know that tens of thousands of people spend some time in jail every year, lets just stop sending people to jail, start saving all that money, and we can count exactly how many $billions we are ahead of the game later, OK?"
3036,"What the hysterical people should realize is that when e.g. a Trudeau takes over- your life doesn't get less hysterical! Some symptoms may change and mutate, but bringing back the long-form census will not have a tangible effect on your lives! So... stop shouting, get off your chairs, and start conversing normally... By far the biggest 'change to democracy' that is being considered is a change to the first past the post voting system. That is an issue that has been consistently rejected by Canadians in all referendums put to them. (ALL OF THEM.) Many consider it undemocratic because it eliminates full direct representation, it creates 'party lists' of unelected MPs, it takes away direct regional representation, and less practical because it creates unworkable coalitions of special interests (Greece, Belgium), etc. Yet this is something that both the Liberals and NDP are threatening to force on us WITHOUT a referendum. See, a real issue. Important. I'm not 'being anti-democratic' by opposing it (along with a majority of Canadians). I'm not a 'stupid con who hates democracy.'Thoughtful replies that are sane, moderate, without personal attacks and slurs and other denigrations and insults are welcome."
11334,"The biggest single criticism I have about the way Alberta has managed its finances is that it has paid so little attention -- almost to the point of ignoring it -- to the Heritage Fund. Year after year, the Fund should have been augmented from available revenues.

Harper gets reelected with a majority and is then going to resign? Really?
7287,"Onr of the unfortunate aspects of denial and anger -in particular with some of the people commenting on this story- is that it helps no one to express anger or simply engage in denial that there is a problem. THis also does a disservice to those poor occidental english who are the ones currently suffering from their myriad issues. Is it not better to offer some ideas rather than close one's eyes and act like there isn't a problem? Offering solutions is the route I'd much rather take. As one can note from my prior posts, some possibilities that may help are if we in Canada can act as role models for these poor, occidental Brits; why not ask some Canadian newcomers to go home and help out directly with those in the old country; why not suggest that these poor occidental Brits marry into African or Pakistani-English families as a means of raising themselves and their social status up? Can anyone else think of possible remedies or aids that can be of help?"
8523,There is a lesson to learn here: culture and national identity might be more important than economic gains. Globalists think that everyone is ready to give up their culture and watch as they become strangers in their own country. Ultra liberals think that ordinary people will willingly give up their identity and traditions for an extra dollar (or pound). This is a lesson that Trudeau should pay attention to.

11343,"There should be a consensus that the article is ill-informed hype. In its latest report, IPCC scientists confirmed that there has been an unpredicted, unexplained and ongoing 'hiatus' in global warming. There is no consensus on the cause of the pause. See page 769 of AR5 for a detailed discussion. DON'T BE LAZY - LOOK IT UP! IPCC politicians simply 'nuked' the info in the Summary for Policy Makers. http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_ALL_FINAL.pdfThe IPCC Working groups have this assessment of the predictions - don't bet on them!: Major uncertainties in IPCC global warming predictions (MY CAPS)IPCC’s “Working Group II” states in Table 21-8: ‘Leading knowledge gaps and related research needs.’ “There is NO clear understanding of how to integrate the diversity of climate change projections data. The full associated uncertainty is weakly characterized and quantifying how much of an observed or simulated climate change is due to internal variability or external forcings is difficult in many situations. Collectively this results in data products with differing time and space resolution and differing dependencies and assumptions that can have CONFLICTING MESSAGES. At present, individual products are plausible and mostly defensible insofar as they have a physical basis within the assumptions of the method. However, at decision-relevant scales, understanding where (or WHETHER) the true outcome will lie within the range of the products collectively is often not possible and thus the products are often not strongly actionable. https://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-PartB_FINAL.pdfLOOK IT UP!Here's where we can readily reach a consensus.

I grew up in a middle class community in west end Ottawa (you would know the area well). What value can I provide in this discussion?

Either way, I don't believe that Canada is a more conservative place. The hard truth is, Conservatives rely on low-information or misinformed voters and low election turnout. If voting was made mandatory in Canada, and if the Liberals and NDP merged, we might not see another Conservative majority here for a very long time."

Germany was where there were FOUR extremist Muslim attacks in a single week (three by refugees). Does that not register with you?

After all, it's not their money. My small city's police all drive new Taurus cruisers - somehow the old Crown Vics all wore out at the same time. They also want a new $34 million headquarters building. The salaries are just part of the cost, and we citizens don't ask enough questions."
9390,"People forget that Canada's 'reputation' within the UN came from sitting on the fence and unmonitored cash donations to despots. We've moved from being 'non-committal peace-keeper at any cost' to a society that can actually see right from wrong and is prepared to stand up for something. Yes, sometimes the government picks the wrong things but at least they are moving in the right direction. Also, the cash we used to throw at 3rd world countries is rightfully seen as going into the pockets of relatives and friends of the ruler-of-the-day. The decline has been happening since oil/gas is being found in regions of the world and the leaders no longer need our money to fill their personal bank accounts. The decline of status specific to Canada is because those despots don't have their money in Canadian banks. Britain, US, Germany, and a couple of others have all that money hidden away. You don't see political actions taken against them because they hold the $$$. On the world scene Canada is a non-player. An easy target with a self-given reputation as an easy mark living in the shadow of the US. The reputation of our easily accessible social programs for countries within the UN is our only remaining attraction."

For the Liberals to be credible candidate for the future government of Canada, they must turn the focus away from their leader (whoever he may be) and show us the party is a viable option. What is missing from the Liberals currently is the appearance of a team of leaders, a group of like-minded persons committed to principled governance of this sometimes great nation. BVB"

You'd be hard pressed to find a country that hasn't committed at some level in the last 200 years, and if you go back a little farther you would find examples of the Iroquois and other tribes meeting the definition of genocide in killing other tribes, forcefully displacing other tribes (they pushed the Sioux west) and assimilating other peoples. None of that excuses more recent history of course, but how do we address the problems going forward shoud be the point. Current survivors of th residentials schools should be compensated, but I disagree with going back to address 150 year old grievances."

Renzetti has the nerve to suggest that this is sexism. Trying to hide weaknesses by claiming sexism is completely unacceptable if women are ever to be respected as serious political participants. It is not that sexism isn't sometimes a factor. This is just a particularly poor example, given Hillary's erratic public performances."
4264,"The general thought in this editorial of people not wanting to speak out is certainly represented in Comments. Probably about 90% of commentators use pseudonyms. Twice when I have seen it queried, some have replied that it is dangerous to use your real name. Some have just said they want to use a pseudonym. So in a sense people who use a pseudonym sort of want to speak out but not in their name. With people using their real name there is no doubt they want to speak out. The G&M is helping people who do not want to speak out in their name. The G&M is contributing to the “problem” defined in the editorial."

In the documents, the agency says $8 million raised for hungry school kids and AIDS patients instead went to Trinity directors. A former Liberal MP, Fontana has also come under scrutiny in a case still before the courts related to a payment for his son's wedding reception in 2005, when he was a cabinet minister in Paul Martin's government.'Heh - maybe he knows where the $3.1 billion went then? Liberals - always trying to do the best the can. For themselves of course. Trudeau did his best for his youth charity as well - Kitamivik. For himself of course."

This has indeed thrust him into the wild and woolly world of politics, given the current climate of opinion where many refuse to accept findings in Science which challenge their vested interests. The shrieking histrionics of Ezra Levant and his followers in these commentaries do little to take away from Suzuki's legacy in Canadian broadcasting and public discourse. It is clear that they are attacking the messenger, while their underlying agenda is that of drowning out science in favour of corporate greed, in Canadian policy."

One could also argue that Blagojevich's fortunes reflect the situation that Chicago is in... with the latter on the brink of doom. On the other hand I also see some benefit from the fake boom. Some parts of thecity are more walkable than 15 years ago. But I concur with your thesis. America is a nation divided."

1236,"Thanks for a nice dose of perspective. I live in Saint John NB which has long prided itself as 'the Loyalist City'. At one time Saint John was the 4th largest English speaking city on the continent, but it has long been in decline and now has less population than Moncton. A component of this decline is a culture that right into the 1950's saw itself as uniquely enlightened and dare I say - Anglican. Lesser souls were certainly seen as being lesser. The city is now culturally much more dominated politically by the descendants of Irish Immigrants and I think, speaking as a person of protestant roots, that the changes toward being less presumptuous have been refreshing. I think we now have a far nicer and more open and more welcoming society here than once we were, and that certainly includes the Anglicans too who have much to be proud of in their great heritage. But we also have a lot of poverty now, and for folks in such circumstances it is never easy or nice. Interesting how our poverty is particularly concentrated on the home turf and still the headquarters of one of Canada's greatest industrial families. So much for trickle down!"

5075,"The first past the post system works fine in a two party model like the US. However, most democratic countries are multi-party. Our system has five parties plus independents meaning the winning party will likely never have a true majority (>50%) of the votes. Further, we only have a participation rate in the 50% area so, if a party wins with, say, 40% of the vote, they only represent 20% of the electorate or, put another way, 80% don't prefer that party. This is not an unfair comparison since too many people don't vote because they cannot support any of the choices that are likely to win and don't make the effort to vote because any other choice would just be wasted. A compulsory voting system, like Australia and other countries use would, at least, give a more defensible mandate to the winner. In my view, a preferential voting system would better reflect the electorates mood on a riding by riding basis without some of the negatives of a proportional system."

6144,"Whatever the truth regarding climate change, I take exception to the language around what should be largely a scientific discussion. The expression 'climate change deniers' is one of those. Since most of us aren't scientists, since there are conflicting scientific reports around this issue, and since the average person seems required to take a 'position' on the science around climate change, the whole thing has ended up with the nasty flavor of religious dogma, where the 'deniers' are the heretics who 500 years ago might very well have burned at the stake."

If the Liberals were ahead by too much, many would not think twice and vote for a third party that has no chance of forming the next government. This voter will hold his nose and vote Liberal, despite the Justin factor, because the previous Liberal administrations (Chrétien/Martin) did leave the country stronger when they left, despite their goofy sponsorship shenanigans. One may hope that middle-of-the-road influences in Mr Trudeau's entourage will produce a government that will not be as bad as the current one."
4207,"I find having female only ceremonies to be the most Canadian way to accommodate our new arrivals. The only reason this is an issue is Stephen Harper is ' Runnin on empty' and without a palatable or reliable platform, poor performance economically a terrible foreign affairs record and the largest debt in Canadian history, his answer was to import a wild dingo from down under who specializes in Wedge politics, pitting a sector of society against the other.

The phrase used mostly to try to explain and somehow justify terrorist act against US, Israel, Britain, etc. We rarely heard it before with regards to other murderous acts committed by crazy individuals like Timothy Mcvey or Anders Breivik in Norway. Both were anti government for different reasons. Try to find root causes and justify acts of those two? Obviously useless, no one even tried. Just lock them up for 1000 years or put on an electric chair. Why then always these words in relation to attacks, suicide bombings, beheadings, other atrocities committed predominantly by islamic terrorists against whoever they don't like? Why try to explain Jihad? Because that was exactly what Trudeau was indirectly implying commenting the Boston bombings. That's the line many in the left anti-US anti-Israel, anti-capitalism, anti-globalism crowd use then talking about terrorist acts commited by radical muslims (sorry, freedom fighters). Poor souls don't agree with our foreign policy so we must change it. They don't like our way of life, our values, so we must adapt them. They feel discriminated, so we must be even more open and welcoming than we already are. Because otherwise they get very very angry. But there are always root causes in us, in our own society, in our foreign policy to look for, right Justin? Until you yourself run marathon in Boston."

3035,"Yes, the long-form census thing shows the depths of Harper Derangement Syndrome in the media. The Liberal government of Jean Chrétien replaced the compulsory Family Expenditure Survey with the voluntary Survey of Household Spending. The result was a spectacular drop in response rates and a reduction in the reliability of the household budget survey (HBS) estimates for calculating Consumer Price Index weights and also for components of the GDP that rely on HBS estimates. estimates. I don't think there is one Canadian in a thousand who is aware of this. As with the killing of the long form census, making the SHS voluntary was guided by the same principle that citizens should have the right to refuse to complete household surveys (but not business surveys). The introduction of the National Household Survey was poorly handled by the Harper government, and has hurt our statistical program, but the damage could have been a lot less if it hadn't been for scaremongering journalists telling us that the response rate could be less than 50%. The American Community Survey got a response rate of over 90% when it went voluntary for a year, while the final weighted response rate for the NHS survey was 77%. Our media should have taken some interest in finding out why this was so, but never did. This was probably due partly to ignorance, partly to laziness and partly to Harper Derangement Syndrome."

5117,"Thank you for the article Margaret and Globeandmail, intriguing and thought-provoking as always! As a medical graduate and aspiring dietician, i argue that neither saturated fats, non-saturated fats or sugars make us fat. Calories make us fat. Weight loss is based on a calorie deficit, or burning more calories than you consume daily. What you eat doesn't really matter. If your body burns 2250kcal/day, you can eat 8 slices of pizza at 2000kcal and lose weight, correct? The reason why me are so worried about fat is because fat has 9calories/gram, while carbs have 4calories/gram. Its easier to get fat with fat, but if you cant calories it doesn't matter. Maintaining a good weight and BMI to reduce morbidity and mortality is a lifestyle choice that we can all make. My suggestion for those who are struggling to lose weight is to count calories and make sure you are in a calorie deficit daily, and find a good diet. Do research and read some excellent diet reviews (http://goo.gl/mbPVrT) and pick one that suits you, keeping in mind any diet will work as long as there is a calorie deficit. A high protein diet, frequent meals and high-carb cheat days help maintain metabolism so you can keep the weight you lose off :). Its becoming more and more easy to blame WHAT we eat for our weight problems, but i believe the answer lies in how MUCH we eat. Good luck everyone. Thank you for the great article Globeandmail."

The criticism of this statement is coming entirely from the United States, a country that maintained a failed policy of isolationism because of disaffected emigres in a swing state and the Conservative party in Canada - currently in the throes of a leadership contest where each participant is clamouring to get noticed in the media and by base in their own party. When a world leader dies, other world leaders say nice things - especially if they have an economic relationship. Canada and Cuba have maintained diplomatic relations without interruption. You can thank Diefenbaker for that and every other subsequent Prime Minister. Could the Prime Minister's statement have been more 'balanced'? Yes. Does the existing statement offend me? No. Everyone knows what Castro's record is. His obituary as a 'friend' of Canada wasn't the time to drag out the negatives. Now is the time to engage and hopefully influence a brighter future for the Cuban people."

8190,"Progressive111, you have a basic misunderstanding of how city government works. Council, not the mayor, makes decisions. The mayor is one vote. He has to be persuasive. Ford utterly lacks this skill. So what really lies behind all your claims? 1. Privatized garbage collection - The 'savings' here is nothing but Ford's seven-year projection of savings, based on nothing. Private collection hasn't saved money in cities like Hamilton (which has a combination of public and private), Winnipeg, or many American cities. In Etobicoke, it's mixed bag of some savings, with service problems. 2. City cleaners contracted out - council prevented Ford from contracting cleaning out to firms that were suspected of underpaying immigrant workers and left a combination of reputable firms and city-paid workers in place3. TTC cleaners contracted out(thus limiting entitlements of overpaid city workers compared to the private sector) - This was spearheaded by Karen Stintz and the Transit Commission, not Ford. But Ford would take credit for a winter thaw if you let him. 4. made TTC an essential service -once again, council voted it in. And it will only lead to higher-priced arbitration in the absence of the right to strike, thus higher-priced fares, etc. Short-sighted thinking. 5. took over TCHC (city housing) and selling 50 city houses to use money for repairs -- council only approved sale of 55 homes; Ford and Holyday wanted more, but council put a leash on Ford's grandiosity6. Budget 2012 passed with only adjustment of $19 million in $9 BILION budget - This budget contained a 2.5% increase in property tax. Ford actually bragged about this. He was also prevented by council from chopping TTC routes, closing wading pools, and scrapping homeless shelters. 7. abolishing the vehicle tax - this caused a raise in everyone's fees and property taxes. It saved no one money. A complete scam. 8. reducing councillors’ office budgets from $55,000 to $30,000 - Ford had his budget slashed by council after his excessive appointments, including the scandalous appointment of the utterly unqualified David Price at an outrageous salary. 9. reduction in spending - budget and property taxes are both higher than under Miller. 10. getting tough on municipal UNIONS - nonsense. They got a raise in salary. 11. achieved labour peace in collective bargaining - A compromise -Ford once again made a fantastical claim, that the raise workers got under him was lower than it would be under some imaginary scenario with someone else as mayor. Ford is a best, a very mediocre mayor with poor people skills. His bad behavior thus makes him completely unqualified for the job."

After living in Canada for 30 odd years I can assure you Canadian politics is not perfect by any standard you like to use. I also have 2 daughters who live in Scotland so have a good feel for the 'old country', and there is absolutely no comparison to the referendum issues in Canada and the UK. Scotland has long been denied it's choice in political parties. It has had it's wealth taken from it by England and, to boot, been kept in the dark about this until recently. Scotland needs to set its own destiny and does not need a snivelling account by someone who obviously has not taken the time to check the facts."

5243,"Wente raises an interesting point but disappoints with a failed analysis. Public sector unions, in the true sense of the union concept are obsolete. By that I mean, unions exist to balance the power of a corporation. Demands and negotiations are constrained by an economic version of MAD - Mutual Assured Destruction. If a union strikes too long, demands too much or the business demands too much and extends a strike, the business fails. Investors lose their money and the union members lose their jobs. However, in the public sector, that MAD dynamic does not exist (although many, including myself would argue another version of MAD, simple 'madness' exists, but that's another story....).When it comes to salary and benefits negotiations, public sector unions should have consultative role but in the end, their ability to strike based on these outcomes should be limited or removed. The public does not have a choice in where we can take our 'business', giving the public sector a monopoly. In those cases, regulation or more specifically, direct government oversight reigns. To balance government mismanagement (abuse of this power), you will see an exodus of teachers, public servants, etc if governments go too far. We've seen this with nursing shortages and also see it in the federal public sector (middle and senior management roles) where people have left to seek better opportunities. The government continues to struggle to recruit and retain good mid/senior level managers. Public sector unions are necessary to protect and represent their members in all other areas - discipline, promotions, general management. Given the past history of government (mis)management, that would be the best and most useful application of union oversight."
3117,"Freedom of speech is a protected right in Canada, and the editorial board at the G&M has a right to their opinions. However, I find their unbending, pro-Conservative at any cost political position deeply disappointing, transparent, and not grounded in reality. This election is, for the most part, a referendum on Steven Harper. The G&M editorial board has chosen to side-step this fact by coming up with a fairy-tale solution, that implores Canadians to still vote for Harper/the Harper Government/Conservative (you choose - they're all the same thing), but tacks on a caveat that he leave office directly following re-election. Memory serves that they also supported Harper in the last election, as well as Hudak in the last Ontario provincial election. I'm no longer surprised in the least at the G&M's unyielding support for the Conservatives, but man it makes it a struggle to keep subscribing at a time like this. However, as in any relationship you have to bear in mind that everyone has their flaws, and sometimes you just have to do your best to look the other way. On a related note, could it be that Margaret Wente was under pressure to eke out some show of support for Harper in her Saturday column? Ultimately, she manages to damn with faint praise. My grade to the G&M on the weekend before the federal election: FAIL"

2092,"The truth is, 60 per cent of Canadians are not Conservatives and didn't vote Conservative in previous elections either. So even though right-wing pundits crowed on these pages about how Harper had 'remade' Canada and turned it more rightward, the vast majority of Canadians hated the Harper government and the Reform Party agenda that the Conservatives adopted. That didn't change. In effect, Harper didn't succeed in changing the nature of the country. In previous elections, the Conservatives managed to ride up the middle, effectively using negative campaigning to discourage voting and to split the Liberals and the NDP ... so they got false majorities, but in fact, 60 per cent of Canadians hated the government we got stuck with. We hated its arrogance, self-entitlement and anti-democratic ways. What changed this time was that: 1) More people voted, and 2) In key ridings where it was between the Liberals and the Conservatives, that 60 per cent piled on the side of the Liberals to shut the Conservatives out for five years. Way to go, Canada! Happy to see their backsides for at least five years, and I am hoping for 10 or 15 or 20, which is what it will take for the Conservatives to find their 'Progressive' side again."

And that is exactly how most non-Liberals will see it - as changing the election laws solely in an attempt to keep one particular group out. The consequence of no referendum is a long term increase in the level of distrust of government by a large percentage of Canadian voters. And that won't be just the Conservatives. How anyone can think that is a good thing for our country is beyond me.

11311,"Actually, Harper ran up over $150 BILLION in debt, only about $55 BILLION was passed in the H of C as 'stimulus spending'. I believe Trudeau's concern was about the other $100 BILLION. And as far as Keynes is concerned, Wente ignores something herself, and that is that Keynes didn't advocate giving corporations massive multi-BILLION dollar tax breaks, when they were already competitive enough and when they had no intention of creating the jobs they had said they would any way. Keynes also advocated that along with stimulus spending, the other half of this equation, must include saving for that rainy day when times are good, in order to 'pay' for that stimulus. Kind of hard to do when you give Canadians a 2% GST tax cut but do not cut the services that 2% paid of. Instead Stevo borrowed that money on the money markets. In other words took a second mortgage out on you without your knowledge. :) Nice hey! ;)"

Baird for instance is far beyond his ability to represent Canada in world affairs. We have gone from a nation that every country could rely upon to be fair and neutral when dealing with international conflict. All sides could look for understanding and assistance in solving difficult problems. Now the Conservatives under Harper have made us into another pariah shill of the American Empire. It really makes me sick!

Whining about Brexit and the election of Trump as indications of the end of democracy is pathetic.

7219,"I want to point to two specific errors Ms. Wente has made. First, there is the conflation of 'academia' and 'university campuses'. The idealism of the student body is hardly surprising. To expect otherwise is to misunderstand what humans are and how they develop. Second, the foundation of her argument rests on ONE study (erroneously attributed to 'STUDIES'), referenced by a piece in the NYTimes. It produced data that demonstrated a much higher identification with liberal ideas than conservative ones than in the past. To be sure, there are much more aggressive demands that structures and institutions change to reflect the new 'consensus'. [But I thought Ms. Wente was a child of the '60s? Has she forgotten her university days?] The problem is that no time is spent examining the devolution of what 'conservative' increasingly means today: elitist, arrogant embrace of inequality and bigotry. Fewer people want to be identified with this group -- seems like a good thing to me."

5210,This isn't about politics! It is about respect for Canada and our laws. If this is how much she respects us now just imagine once she receives citizenship. IF these people insist on coming here to live and our governments continue to allow them in the least they can do is show respect and gratitude. We aren't telling them how to live in their countries. Why are we allowing the world to tell us how to run ours? I didn't vote for this!
11215,"The writer usually posts very good articles of interest and amusement for the readership but this time she succeeded in stirring up her readers against Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for her former country. It sometimes appears quite strongly that she wants to reassure Canadians that she is really one of them and wants to endear herself to her adopted country. Just saying! Much of her work about Canada and Canadians is quite good and I thoroughly enjoyed the one on the utility of the Canadian canoe. In the end it will be the American people who decides the outcome of the election and as you likely know Americans don't really care or read about what Canadians think about them or their Republic. This is most unfortunate but a few of us do and know Canada perhaps more than most Canadians. In this election the great documents so precious and necessary for our continuation of the oldest form of democracy existing today since ancient Greece is at stake. Admittedly both aspirants for the presidency lack in character and to some extent in morality, the one who has never held office has the advantage and deserves the office as the other has a trail of baggage of which can be discarded but giving false information under oath is a very serious matter not to mention the omission of the real truth of Benghazi to the American people and only sharing the truth with her daughter, is unforgivable. The intentional and careless handling of sensitive official governmental documents......a long list of indictment material we have all heard. What is distressing is that many of the younger generations disregard all that. So Margaret, where is your sense of propriety when it comes to selecting candidate fit for office?"

They have no way of knowing that you hold another citizenship unless you tell them, especially if you were born here. If your parents were American and you were born here the only way the Americans would know that you have American ties is if your parents registered your birth in the US. If your parents didn't do that they have no way of knowing that information unless you voluntarily tell them. If you immigrated from the US and did not renounce as soon as you became a Canadian hoping for the best of both worlds, too bad, it's your own fault."

Shame for you and Mr. Harper to even try to defend this throwback to the electoral policies of the US south in the 60's. Did the ideas for this legislation come from consultants to the Republican Party in the US???"
9261,"As a defence lawyer, I disagree strongly with the suggestion that more money = a more aggressive lawyer or better lawyer. Obviously some lawyers who cost a lot of money do a great job, but the defence bar as a whole takes a lot of pride in the work we do. We are constantly taking on unpopular causes for very little remuneration, not because we enjoy being underpaid and taking scorn from the public, but we feel like it's the right thing to do.

11534,"So right-wingers are stupid – it's official. Psychologists in Canada have compared IQ scores of several thousand British children, who were born in 1958 and 1970, with their stated views as adults on things such as treatment of criminals and openness to working with or living near to people of other races. They also looked at some US data which compared IQ scores with homophobic attitudes. The conclusion: your intelligence as a child correlates strongly with socially liberal views. People with low IQs tend to be more in favour of harsh punishments, more homophobic and more likely to be racist. Interestingly, as these were IQ scores measured when young this does seem to be a measure of something innate, not merely exposure to 'liberal' views through education. The inference is that what we call conservatism is a symptom of limited intellectual ability, signified by fear of the new and of outsiders, a retreat into tradition and tribal loyalty, and an unsophisticated disgust at sexual mores that deviate even slightly from the norm. Put bluntly stupidity correlates with insecurity, hatred, pessimism and fear, intelligence with confidence, optimism and trust. www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2097652/Does-low-IQ-make-right-wing-That-depends-define-left-right.html#ixzz2Uz0P1ZnS Follow us: @MailOnline on Twitter | DailyMail on Facebook"

I also suggest that most of the people against the use of fossil fuels are not prepared to live with the alternatives. The great true cheap alternative to fossil fuels is nuclear which has become a non starter among most of the very same people.
3473,"Among my people there is an ancient saying 'The truth hurts.' This article clearly illustrates how profound the wisdom of my elders, who hail from some small islands across the big water, truly is. It's a shame nostalgia and romance have so much clout in real world circles of politicos."
270,This article seems to posit that the rejection of the Harper government was based on emotion (vindictiveness) rather than logic. That seems to be the prevailing view expressed in conservative analysis of the election results e.g. we used the wrong tone. If that view proves to be the dominant view within the party it will be hard for them to make the changes necessary to return them to power in 4 years.
3835,"After watching the debate they organized, I sort of knew the editorial board's credibility was debatable..."
4146,I agree with the author. The original 'immigrants' were the French and the English to Canada. They completely destroyed the existing aboriginal society. Yet we all happily live with the results of their policies. The numbers and places of origin of our new immigrants should be monitored and regulated. But we need immigration or we risk involution as a country.
5613,"A truly disgusting display of vindictiveness by a puerile, petulant PM who didn't get his way. McLachlin is a paragon of honesty and integrity compared to bottom-feeding Harper whose readiness to lie is thoroughly documented by past actions."
7605,Scared of Trudeau? That made me laugh out loud. Like saying that you are afraid of the village idiot.
1268,"Even though big science has a blank social license, which it can expand by lobbying, big science cannot create energy or negative entropy. Science as a service sector industry obtains its energy from nature through society, thus its interest is served very well by promising (without guarantee of course) more energy for society from nature. Science, however, doesn't seem to have much imagination regarding the consequences for nature of ever increasing rate of conversion of nature. As for the ever increasing rate of entropy production by society, science does as any other industry: it disowns as much of the entropy increase as possible by classifying it as non-'pollution' entropy increase of no consequence whatsoever. The strategy seems to work while stocks and flows of energy from nature are abundant and easily converted, and nature is sufficiently vast enough to absorb the burgeoning wastes. But those conditions no longer exist. Please, science is just another industry, which loads nature by its real world processes, and society by its self-serving political manipulations for more funding. Why can't science have a social license which accounts for its limits?"
5669,So the Globe and Mail argues for road tolls in ADDITION to everything else already being collected for roads. The Globe and Mail also argues for Mulcair and Trudeau. Put 1 and 1 together and hopefully get 2.

1065,"Actually the article is totally inaccurate. Ford won by emphasizing fiscal responsibility, solid mechanics in responding to average citizen complaints, instead of his predecessors predisposition to social causes, lavish spending and entitlement. Quite simply, he fumbled by being a hypocrite, engaging in criminal and boorish behaviour, and ignoring his claim to being 'responsible'. There really was no Ford nation, just a citizenry disgruntled with Miller and his cabal. Ford cannot win the next election because he abandoned his principles, has been found out, and will, if he runs, get pummelled. No big class conspiracy, no secret overthrow of government, no puzzle: he will lose by his own doing and deservedly so. To blame conservatives for his failures is simply ridiculous. People are mistaking notoriety with electability. His initial platform was electable, his ongoing downfall created a notoriety that will yield the proper result: his failure to win. Give people, even conservatives some credit. The writer is quite insulting and completely wrong in his suppositions. As usual overly complicated and citing correlations, with no real evidence in his hypotheses."

4230,"The most important reason for the Conservative loss was the arrogant and secretive control-freak prime minister. The electorate, as a whole, didn't give a thought to to the CPC policies. It wanted this nasty man removed. It took the step to ensure that he was gone by taking votes from the NDP to ensure a majority that would kick the CPC out. The second aspect not covered in this article was the CPC caucus which did not stand up to the PM and the PMO control. The CPC members were complicit in the establishment of a system that denied the role of Parliament in our democracy. I hope that the CPC reconsiders what they did. If not, I hope they remain out of power for a long time."

6091,"I think this is more a matter of timing. Had it become clear the Boston Marathon bombings were part of a large coordinated plan like the 9-11 bombings, Trudeau's question would be right on the mark. It's still a legitimate question. I mean, how did this 26 year-old get so bitter and twisted that he transferred a Muslim holy war from Southern Russia to the United States? Sorry Jeffrey, not a 'gaffe'. Just the CPC's attack squad, with help from USA Republicans."
2559,"Who ever wrote this editorial would have been better to bring it to an end after the first paragraph. No great insight in that first paragraph, but a reasonably accurate statement.

5077,"I'm pro-choice and no fan of the present government. And Ms. Wente is right - opponents of the government would accuse them of trying to re-open the debate. It's really a no-win situation for the government. However, this is all part of a worrisome longer-term trend of the concentration of power in the PMO. Most commentators believe that it started under Trudeau and has increased under every PM since. The opposition always promises change, but finds the current system suits its needs and ends up solidifying it.What I'd like to see is meaningful democratic reform, something that treats MPs as more than talking point spewers and votes to be whipped."
7629,CBC loves Boy Wonder and anything Liberal. Liberals simply returning the favor. No different to Wynne's Liberals and $Millions handed public sector unions of Ontario. Public money used to pay off partisan henchmen.

3077,"Naomi Klein simply doesn't understand that big, bad capitalists only make their big, bad profit by selling things that people are voluntarily willing to buy. Period. That's the defining characteristic of a private market. If she wants people to curtail their CO2 emissions by 50-80%, then she'd best 'show us a way' to live a decent life without the myriad benefits that energy provides. If she were able to do so, people would follow in a heartbeat, even those who are skeptical about how much impact human activity has on the climate. But when she and her band of retrograde ex-Communists insist this is a matter of good versus evil and want governments to force people to live in tents (the only way we can currently cut our emissions by 50% or more), she finds - surprise!- that people in both the developed and developing world dismiss her as a self-promoting hypocrite."

Prepare for your learning to take an additional 4-8 years on average. I will happily stand behind you when the bullets fly, and I will happily serve you drinking water as you tend to a dying child.

It's a two-step plan to let incumbents cheat, and exert influence to make sure that investigations of that cheating only target the non-governing parties. Harper might as well just have tabled a bill to make himself President for Life."
2396,"I would like to suggest that if Trudeau-Lite and his merry band of Intelligentsia feel this is such a pressing issue, and supported by all 'Thinking Canadians', they should indeed hold a referendum.

7472,"yeah, yeah, here we go, Canada's most eagerly dismissed and oft-maligned minority is making a fuss, so of course their has to be a media campaign to delegitimize their grievances and demands. This elite media script is so played out, and yet people still eat it right up.The issue is not one person's alleged behavior, or not even trusting Canada's completely corporate-compromised media, it's native people, the near genocide they've endured, and their rights to dignity and self determination. Let's not loose sight of that please."
6132,"Well, we can count on the CBC not to investigate or pursue this story. It's still waiting its promised payoff from the federal Liberals. As for the OPP, well it already has received its payoff from the provincial Liberals and allowed itself to be paid off. The chances of it investigating the provincial Liberals in the gas plant scandal in a timely fashion, in particular the deletion of emails, is just about zero. The most disturbing thing about the provincial Liberals in Ontario isn't the money wasted, though that seems to occupy most of the attention of posters, but the destruction of the integrity of the executive. Welcome to South America north."
1284,"Who better to advise what not to do than a person who had a large hand in the strategy that lead to the party's most recent defeat. But does this article really do that? Rather than any personal acknowledgments, it seems to contain a lot of finger pointing at others who are alleged not to have done the right things. That is not the sort of candid soul searching and mea culpa that could lead to rejuvenation."
9490,"Chrretien won because the center right vote was split so in fact liberal canada may have died prior to him. Also the liberals have elected a series of poor leaders including the current one. At the end of the day, it may be better for Canada to have a centre right and a centre left party"

8207,"Most people in Canada feel indifferent about the monarchy, don't have really strong feelings one way or the other. It shows a healthy disdain for those who love to scrape and bow to their betters as well as for those who are always eager to re-arrange the political furniture to give themselves a little ego-boost. I'd be surprised if Europeans have any particular awareness about the Canadian head of state. We have no idea about their political arrangements. The average Canadian knows that Obama is president of the US, that we and Britain, Australia and New Zealand share the Queen in some weird way and also have Prime Ministers whose names we don't remember and that's about it. We certainly don't worry about it.Happy Canada Day!"
1577,"OMG is this a different form of 'sponsored content'?I realize that The G & M is a Business newspaper but this willful blindness to a tired, unaccountable, entitled, entrenched viewpoint is worthy of Preston Manning (who's probably still trying to help Calgary developers unseat Nenshi)."
8077,"the biggest thing holding Canadians back financially is housing coststhey need to come down to make Canada competitive again, lower house prices mean less need for higher wages means less labor input costs but Trudeau's answer is to push Canadian millennials concerns aside and welcome well moneyed immigrants, foreign visa holders and students to support existing housing costsTrudeau has in fact betrayed millennials"

If public sector unionists believe these benefits are appropriate they should have lobbied for like pensions, healthcare, benefits and working conditions for all Canadians. Instead they backed political parties that pandered to their unions. We've been put into a position where public sector entitlements will have to be brought down to private sector averages before we can have an intelligent conversation about what we can afford to provide for all Canadians."

That said, anyone born with a penis and related stuff between their legs knows why men sit with their legs apart. It is simply much more comfortable, or put another way, eliminates the discomfort of sitting with your legs pressed tightly together. Margarets advice to some of these women to man up is sensible. No one should have to endure bad manners. But another piece of advice to some of these women is to think about what it is like to be a man. It isn't the same as being a woman. Not better, not worse. Just different. Respect for differences should be mutual."

2286,"In Thunder Bay, where I lived for a time, sending your kids to Catholic School was essentially a declaration that you didn't want your kids to go to school with Native kids. I had several people advise me to send my kids to Catholic school on that basis. Here in London, where I now live, the local Catholic school actively encourages any kids with learning disabilities to leave the school and enroll in the public school. This both save the Catholic board money and artificially inflates its scores on the province-wide testing, helping to reinforce the perception that the Catholic board is 'better'. The Catholic school system, in short, is awash in money but doesn't want to deal with social problems and/or more challenging (and capital intensive) students. It creates two classes of education in the province and is an anachronism that needs to be done away with."

Even if MOST of them did it with some horrid sense of abhorrent humour or thoughtlessness, I'm not taking the chance that ALL of them did. If people have those sick thoughts in their heads, at no time in their lives should they be allowed to be in such a position of power over other human beings. I happen to know there are plenty of positions open at coffee shops they can have."

Sexism, racism and discrimination against LGBTQ people in Canada have never been polite things, so how can mainstream Canadian society now expect to be treated with the charity and civility it refused to show to vulnerable groups in the past?'Part of the problem is precisely this kind of mentality, that 'mainstream Canadian society', ( i.e. average people who can be described as being part of mainstream society) deserves to be mistreated, and denied 'charity and civlity', because of some generalized past offenses by 'mainstream society'. What kind of reasoning is that?"

6169,"The pseudo-science theory of global warming/climate change that we are expected to believe in has many of the attributes of a religion. Garden of Eden before humans sinned: time before coal, oil and gas use. The Serpent and the forbidden fruit: oil companies and oil. The Flood: melting ice caps and rising sea levels. Burning in Hell: planet warming, droughts, forest fires, mass extinctions. Devils: Harper, Koch brothers, Exxon. Road to Hell: Northern Gateway, Keystone XL, Line 9, Kinder Morgan Pipeline. Sins of gluttony: energy use, incandescent light bulbs, SUVs. Repentance: apology for using coal, oil and gas and promise to stop. Hypocritical high priests who do not practice what they preach: Al Gore, David Suzuki, Tom Stayer, John Kerry, Prince Charles. Fanatical religious orders: WWF, Greenpeace, Sierra Club, Forest Ethics, Environmental Defense. Clergy living off religion: IPCC, Climate Science academics. Arcane knowledge: IPCC computer models, interpretation of tree rings. Persecution of non-believers: calling people deniers, flat earthers, academic intolerance, bullying. Selling of indulgences: trading in carbon credits. Tithes: carbon taxes, climate research grants, lucrative contracts for green cronies. Use of religion by political leaders to scare and manipulate masses: Obama’s EPA rules, John Kerry's speeches. Religious symbols: wind turbines, solar panels, CF light bulbs. Need for faith due to lack of evidence: no evidence of warming for 17 years. Vague promise of redemption for believers: climate will stabilize at an ideal level in some distant future if we give money and power to the high priests and do as they say (not as they do)."

9329,"It depends if he is a risk taker or risk averse. If a risk taker, I would say stay as Justin Trudeau's lead in the polls is no bigger than Ignatieff or Dion had when chosen and likewise due to the Tory base being more likely to show up at the polls, they usually get 2-3% higher thus winning the next election is at least possible although certainly not guaranteed. If risk averse, then best to step down. In Western Canada and Ontario, the party got close to their ceiling in support so they best Harper can do is maintain that level of support, not grow it. The only place where there are a whole wack of seats they could pick up is in Quebec and considering Harper's unpopularity there, that won't happen as long as he is leader whereas under a different leader who knows. Otherwise Harper's support has maxed out so he will likely do worse next time around or at best get the same so best to leave at one's peak not when in decline. Off course choosing a new leader won't necessarily help the party either."

8311,Here's a list for you to digest Justin. This is leadership. It is quite different than the blue sky fluff you go on about. Harper has worked hard to ease the tax burden on the middle class (GST reductions). He has created new ways for Candians to save and avoid taxes (TFSA). He has invested in infrastructure (jobs). He is tightening EI rules so that the real working Canadians are not paying through their teeth to support the part timers. He bailed out the auto industry to save tens of thousands of jobs. The list of Harper's efforts to help the middle class is very long. Your accomplishments amount to nothing. Try harder!

Total denial and coverup until, you guessed it, a variety store videotape was sent to the Windsor Star. In Ottawa, a young black woman was arrested by police who thought she was drunk because she said 'you wouldn't be arresting me if I was white'. At the police station, they stripped and beat her viciously. Nobody knew until, you guessed it, someone sent the police station video to the Ottawa Citizen. To the small number of thug-cops (most are good guys): your days are numbered. We're watching you. In the case of Sammy Yatim, the cop is either (1) a fearful coward, (2) a poorly trained and unrestricted moron or (3) a total thug."

10146,"As a survivor of physical and sexual assault, I can still recognize when an issue like this is being used for politics, with no concern for the people being trashed in the process. I'm definitely all in favour of reporting and charging someone who is guilty of actual sexual assault, but this has been fishy from day 1. Pacetti says he is innocent of wrongdoing, and he has to be able to tell his story. Kudos to Wente for writing a common sense article, common sense about sex between adults, and common sense about shutting your mouth unless you really do have an assault charge to lay. The fact that they were not willing to go into an inquiry, but were more than willing to yap like town criers to any media willing to print their story, says loud and clear that the objective was to destroy these two men, to ruin Liberal polling, and finally for the NDP to grab hold of the 'protector of women in parliament' banner for themselves. Finally, I think the media that published the sordid details of these alleged encounters are unethical, and they should be sued for libel. There was no proof of any of it, it was hearsay. It should never have made press beyond the fact that there are alleged issues between the MPs. It is under investigation - same as if it was in court. These 'hearsay' details are believed by the gullible, and have probably ruined lives."

11128,"The Liberal party in Ontario and Federally right now is not the responsible party it once was. It used to be a centrist party that a large number of Canadians could relate to. Today it is too left wing. I'm okay with a centre-left party but not a leftist party. Trudeau is unprepared and seems to think it is still the 1970s and Wynne ( thought very likeable personally) is being very reckless with her new budget, which adds even more to the deficit than last year, even though we are now 2 years out of the recession."

6131,"What amazes me is that we seem to have an unending stream of these revelations, producing a few days of indignation in the press, then back to business as usual. That this malfeasance in office is sucking the economic life out of the Province seems to affect no one. Amazing. Billions of taxpayer dollars diverted -- businesses lost, lives ruined, not once but many times. And in a few days it will all be swept under the rug and business as usual resumes. Makes the arrogance of the French aristocracy prior to the Revolution seem puny in comparison. Ontario... Zimbabwe North or one of the 'stans. How can we compare when they are outstanding along so many dimensions?"
2248,"This wasn't about making the world a better place. Harper doesn't need the support of a House of Commons vote to send planes and troops to Iraq, and besides he has nothing but contempt for the House of Commons anyways. This was always strictly a political maneuver by Harper to trap the opposition parties (at least the Liberals) into supporting his foreign venture on the record so that if things went bad down the road in some way in an election year the Liberals wouldn't be able to use his foreign adventure against him. This was all about cynical politics and as smart as Lloyd Axworthy and others are, they are blinded by a noble cause and missing the knives in the Conservative hands. The Liberals have dodged a bullet here and retained the right to hold Harper's feet to the fire if this mission goes badly as most expect it will."
289,We should make an agreement that all efforts will be made to wipe out ISIS but we should also pledge to end the decades old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. This is where the seed of hatred was planted and grew to what it is today. The West must accept its share of the blame for todays events and show equal determination to act on both issues. It's time to say 'No' to Israel and make clear that its policies of the past decades have brought us to where we are today. Hamas found its following from the feeling of helplessness amongst Palestinians. ISIS has in many ways found a following amongst those who feel they have little future. Fight to the bitter end for 'Fairness & Freedom' but use an Equitable and Fair Hand. The same set of rules for everyone.
9269,"Canada' pinnacle standing on the world stage was immediately after the second world war. There are two reasons: 1. The defeat or exhaustion of many of the big players. 2. The outsize military Canada had built up. At the end of the second world war, the US was nearly half of all the planets' economic output. And that is just one measure of that country's global supremacy. However, on a different scale, they as well wonder about their change/decline in world stature. It has nothing to do with the people in power, just the change in relative world fortunes. Pearson's times? If Canada had an equivalent military today it would have over half a million in arms, a 100 + ship navy, and nearly 1,000 front line fighter aircraft, as well as bombers, etc. Is that what you want?"

1369,"Firefighters HAVE NOT been receiving raises twice as high as other public sector workers or private for that matter. The expected increase in the private sector in 2013 is 3.1 per cent, slightly above the three per cent increase given last year. The average increase for employees in the public sector is expected to be 2.8 per cent in 2013. Owen Sound firefighters actually make a salary closer to $80,000 per year, the 29 firefighters on the Sunshine list making $100,000+ only did so because they received 3 years worth of back pay from the arbitrators rulinga 24 hour shift averages out to a 42 hour work which is longer than the typical Canadian's 40 hour work week. Is there down time? Absolutely, but there is down time within every job. Anyone who claims they work non stop for their entire 40 hours per week is lying to you. I've worked enough jobs to know that two hour lunches, time on the golf course, surfing the net, gossiping, etc fill a great part of the week in many professions. Firefighters are not given a lunch hour or 15 minute breaks, and preparing and eating meals are often interrupted by responding to calls. They don't complain, it's part of the job. Contrary to popular belief there still are MANY fires. They burn hotter than ever before and are more dangerous due to lightweight building construction and synthetics. A city like Toronto will have more than a dozen fires per day, most of which will never make the news because they are small kitchen or electrical fires with no injuries. Pumpers responding to medical calls do not cost a million dollars, $300,000 is a more accurate figure. The pumper and 4 firefighters are already stationed in the firehall regardless, so responding to a medical call in the area is a value added service firefighters can provide 'in their downtime' for the low cost of just a few litres of diesel. Lastly, the sunshine list has been around a very long time now. Earning $100,000 today is a very good salary but is hardly the same as earning $100,000 in 1993. If it was adjusted for inflation, $139,000 in 2013 would be the same as $100,000 when the Sunshine list was first created."

Context is everything and any historian worth their salt would have documented the conditions around the time that any prime minister would have been governing to give a thorough account of their history.

Our campaign finance rules don't ensure 'fairer' elections; they ensure that individuals with name recognition like Trudeau's start with a huge advantage that can't be overcome with media buys. The other thing that author misses is that almost the sole reason that Trump is winning is because people are tired of Liberal scolds telling them to who they have to vote for. Trump's supporters know he is an idiot. They don't care. They are going to make him President anyway."
1026,"I think the ads are clumsy but I don't think the comparison with the 93 ad stands up. The ads do not target Trudeau Jr's physical features or speech but his wafer thin CV and hostility to western Canada. Those are matters of public record and and it is perfectly reasonable to hold someone aspiring to the PM's office to account for their public statements and lack of qualifications. That said, if I were advising Harper I would say to ease off on the attacks. Trudeau Jr is a very weak and inexperienced candidate who can be relied upon to put his foot in his mouth on a fairly regular basis. Given his weakness, the Conservatives & NDP don't need to attack him - under the glare of a national election Trudeau Jr's ineptitude and inexperience will be more than enough to destroy his chances."
7451,"In my sense of morality, trying to bribe a dying man is much worse than using tax dollars and MP privilege to trash your opponent. Although there is some truth to saying that attack ads are a form of bullying I consider attempting to coerce a dying man is an even more despicable form of bullying. And I doubt there is a religion in the world that would condone such behavior."

8268,"No one's asking anyone to like the niqab. The only question is how to discourage it in our culture. I think example, education, social norms and social persuasion are likely to be highly effective over time, especially with second generstion.. Personally, I dislike the niqb and it bothers me to see it. But given we are a free society, how could it be banned by law? Law is not the only way to change behaviour."
6235,"The problem with climate change activism for Canada is twofold. First, our economy is now heavily dependent on exporting the oil, gas, and coal that we have in abundance. Quite possibly other industries could replace this activity within a half century or more, but if we try to shut down the extraction industries too quickly, it will mean condemning a couple of generations of Canadians to a significantly lower standard of living. That doesn't mean we shouldn't cut back on our own consumption, but it does mean that no Canadian politician, of any party, can afford to choke off the supply of Canadian energy to countries that need and want it.The second difficulty is even more perturbing. Climate change would clearly be a huge problem for many parts of the world. But it is not clear that the disadvantages of warming to Canada, measured in economic terms, would be greater than the benefits. One can argue that there are hidden non-economic costs, like species loss, and one can certainly argue that Canadians need to step up to the plate for the benefit of the world as a whole. Will Canadian politicians be able to make these arguments? Perhaps, if the religion that is being preached by the activists is successful in gaining enough converts. The last time a grand, implausible idea managed to overcome a deeply entrenched world view was in the fourth century (CE). But then there was that little matter of the subsequent Dark Ages."
10385,"Perfect commentary! I believe in helping those less fortunate in our society, whether they be homeless, health issues, or on an impoverished reserve.

Then somebody types my name into a data base and nothing comes up and they give me the go ahead. You know who else likes the timeline? The hungry, innocent children trying to find a life. Canadians, you can't have it both ways. You can't complain that politicians lie and never keep their promises and then moan when they try their very hardest to do just that despite it not being easy nor politically expedient. The idea that we can trust our politicians is more important than the substance. Even if it is the wrong decision I love the fact that he is doing what he said. Sort of like Harper and the HST.

2253,"The comments here are an excellent reflection of the dangers of living in an echo chamber and talking only with those who agree with you. You hate the PM and consider any alternative preferable, and have for the better part of a decade, thus you assume everyone is that desperate to get rid of him. But they aren't, and successive elections have taught you they aren't.You like your candidate and thus assume any comment against him must be a cheap attack from the people you hate, so you both dismiss whether the attack is effective, and you assume its presence is not a problem. Then you end up sitting there on election night trying to figure out how your guy lost. You wondered it with Dion. You wondered it with Ignatieff. In the states, they REALLY wondered it with Kerry. You can't preach to the choir in politics. You need to be fighting to persuade the voters you need. And you can't assume they will be moved by the same arguments you are. Say what you will about the conservative machine, but that is unquestionably what they have mastered. They figure out the people who they need who could go either way, tone down anything those people will see as negative, and reinforce any negative opinions those people have on their opponents. While the liberals just keep on assuming everyone sees the attacks as they do, and that no one needs to be sold on why the conservatives are bad or their guy is better."

That is why they have not shared the critics’ hysteria.”There is a level of d—chb-gedness here that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with a fork.

This kind of statements is what creates more Muslim radicals. If Muslims like you want to build a better relationship with the West, you have to start uniting the Muslim sects first, the act as a group to build a bridge with the West under actions that will bring TRUST. Without having a unified Muslim religions, the world will continue to witness what we see in Syria and Iraq.

3150,Mr. Simpson has clearly outlined the characteristics of the conservative/Conservative Ford Nation. The inability to see the astonishing inappropriateness of Mayor Ford's over-the-top behaviour; the belief that no matter what craziness he gets up to he's a good mayor because he has saved them money and tried to keep government small; the illusion that this millionaire who consorts with drug dealers is really just one the folks. This mindless conservatism/Conservatism is not confined to the Ford Nation. We saw it during the Harris election in Ontario ( Mike Harris-the tax fighter) and it is exists in an especially virulent form in the United States in the Tea Party and it exactly describes the Harper government.. Where does it come from? It comes in no small part from a relentless public relations campaign ( which the mainstream media participates in ) that ceaslessly promotes the ideas that taxes are bad; government is bad; unions are bad; privitization is good; supply-side economics is good; deregulation is good etc. etc. There are at least two generations of citizens who have heard nothing else.

17,"'Since taking power, the NDP government has often been more Stephen Harper than Justin Trudeau, curtailing reporters’ access and ending press conferences when it didn’t like what was being asked.

The irony couldn't be thicker. It's also a flat out lie. Trudeau has made himself and his cabinet refreshingly accessible to the press and the public. Now I don't know what's going on with the Alberta legislature - other than the fact the Rebel Media crew have at least one wannabe assassin in their ranks. How soon will it be before the Globe is giving Ezra column space. After Jenni Byrne, it wouldn't be a stretch. Yes, Globe, 'what began as petty' editorials is 'evolving into something far far worse.'

8295,"The expert Wente quotes states that the results of marijuana legalization would be uncertain; yet she herself goes on to say that to do so would have negative repercussions. That's not what her expert said. Her argument against Trudeau's position is illogical. Trudeau said that by regulating marijuana, its consumption can be controlled, which is true because currently it is sold to anyone who knows a pusher. But in a regulated environment, the persons selling it will ensure it is not sold to minors, just as with cigarettes. So his argument is true. Wente looks at it simply from the price / consumption point of view, and ignores the whole matter of controlled distribution at the point of sale. So her attack on Trudeau is unfair and unfounded. Wente points out that she herself smoked marijuana, so she is inconsistent now to maintain that it should remain a criminal activity. If she truly believes this, she ought to submit to criminal charges for her misconduct in this regard. Wente points out that most Canadians are in favour of decriminalizing marijuana use, yet asserts that it is bad public policy to do so. She doesn't realize her position is elitist and anti-democratic. She knows what's best for everyone, like Ontario's former 'Premier Dad'. She really doesn't believe in individual choice and responsibility: she wants the state to use the criminal law to control and limit individual behaviour. As for the merits of the issue itself, Canadians deserve to have a choice on this issue, and Trudeau is giving it to them. That's what politicians are supposed to do.Now, if we can just get a major federal leader to commit to scrapping free trade agreements, increasing corporate tariffs, limiting foreign ownership of Canadian resources, end Canada's involvement in illegal foreign wars, and put some meaningful consequences in place for politicians who misconduct themselves, then that would be great."

I know most women will vehemently disagree with me, but the evidence is quite clear if only women would open their eyes. We certainly can't go back to the preindustrial family, but surely we can return to a partnership between a man and a woman with commitment, fildelity, and responsibility on both sides. First we must recognize that men and women are different and need to work towards the benefit of the family and not just individual career aspirations. Second promiscuity and out of wedlock births must be socially unacceptable. Lot's of changes are needed, but first this issue of equality between the sexes needs to be reassessed in a serious way."

6133,"Just for context. When I worked for Ontario Hydro 40 years ago we ran the enterprise on four key parameters: Safety. Reliability. Citizenship (heavy on the Environment), and economics. We fought to reduce the cost of a kW- hr of reliable power for the people of Ontario by fractions of a penny! In balance with the other parameters or you didn't get a raise. Now the enterprise is run by the whims of an ideologue. Unfortunately we now have one in Ottawa and another in Alberta as well so I can see where this is going and it isn't pretty. A green Ontario only had to challenge the workers of OPG with the challenge to burn coal and other fossil fuels in clean fashion and I am convinced that given time and a fraction of the money and they would have risen to the challenge with world beating technology. But windmills and solar panels project far more progressive symbols of real change."

Justin Beiber would have had a hard time keeping up to the 70 year old Trump. Every stadium, conventions hall, sports arena, and gymnasium was filled to over flowing. In Orlando a soccer stadium that holds 10,000 people had 5,000 standing outside. He spoke in person to over a million people. But what did our news media report about in spite of all that? The media only reported disparagingly that Trump used a teleprompter. Nothing else was news worthy. Hillary canceled rallies for lack of attendance and even good rallies only had a few hundred attending. That's why he knew the election would have been rigged if he lost."

Simons also says she was told the Journal would not be endorsing anyone in the election, and so the decision took her by surprise. The Herald's Jason Markusoff was quick to distance himself from his paper's endorsement, noting that reporters and staff learn of editorial board decisions at the same time as the public.

She's written many times that Khan, Coursera and other distance education technologies are the answer. That may be so if the main goal is getting rid of teachers unions, but these technologies are hardly a model for educating young children, who need social skills, hands on skills, and not more time alone in front of screens."

272,"While I agree post-partisanship is a marketing ploy, the fact is that all political messaging falls into the same bucket, and the timing of its use is dictated by circumstances. As for the 'the smiling face of vindictiveness', it is worthy to note that Trudeau explicitly stated '...conservatives are not our enemies, but our neighbors', and the Republicans have upheld their pledge not to cooperate with Obama under any terms during his presidency. There is constituency on either side of the divide whose allegiance to a party is paramount because they do not believe another party could ever represent them. Those of us who are open to new and different ideas wherever they come from tend to tip the balance in Canadian elections. I did not vote for either Conservatives or Liberals, but I was personally drawn to the positive rather than negative messaging. In the end, my vote was based on the policy choices made by the outgoing Conservative government. When a government piles on $180 billion in new debt over a 7 year period, it is rather odd they would campaign against such as ruinous and catastrophic."

Who says you can’t get a great job in Ontario.•This one is my favourite, it’s so out there! Did you give $485,000 to Saad Rafi when his job running the Pan Am Games ended and then hire him again to run the ORPP even though he has never had an investment mandate before?

If you watch The First 48 (on A&E), you'll also find out that most often police charge with murder not just those who did the killing, but those who enabled it, even if they sat outside in an idling vehicle. Almost looks like the occupants of at least 11 cruisers that showed up should be equally charged for aiding and abetting, no?"

But the Globe doesn't clarify. I'd like to see the Globe be consistent. Call out the other racists around the world. What rights do non-muslims have in muslim countries? How does Saudi Arabia treat its foreign workers from India? I'll leave it to your imagination. How do the Mexican authorities treat illegal migrants from El Salvador and Honduras? There are documentaries on this, and it is quite brutal how the Mexicans treat their illegals. How about China that has labelled the Falun Gong - a religion as an illegal cult. They've used Falun Gong members for organ harvesting. Ever hear about how China treats its muslim minority? You won't hear it in the Globe. Has the Globe called the Chinese government 'racist'?"

Secondly, considering the alternative to the liberal viewpoint, what ELSE can one possibly feel if it isn't contempt? Nine out of eleven Republican candidates during their last primaries said they believe in Creationism! This is grave! That the supposed cream of Republican politicos put belief against science and reason when determining policy? 'Contempt' is the only word that correctly comes to mind. When most of their leaders and flock ignore or reject Global Warming for decades, either because they are too dumb to understand the science or rather because they don't want anything to get in the way of their bottom lines - well, what else but contempt does one feel for people who can't see further than the nose on their face? I predict that if the Republicans win the next election, it will be the last straw in America's race to the bottom, and it will continually become worse for everyone inside or outside of that country. Then even 'contempt' will be too mild a word to describe the outcome. John Stewart's 'liberal contempt' was justly earned by such Republicans; Obama and the Dems might have made mistakes , but none were because of stupidity, insistence on dogma as opposed to pragmatism."

He has protected and employed the very same bankers that the last guy used and those very same bankers were the cause of the 2008 crisis. Barry has the benefit of the rear view mirror and still these guys walk the streets and become richer. 3. His 'most transparent presidency ever' has prosecuted whistle blowers and driven one to Russia. 4. Guantanamo is still a prison. 5. His 'affordable' medical insurance has actually increased the price for millions of Americans. 6.He rules by fiat since he couldn't even pass legislation in his first term with democratic house and congress. 7.He is the president who has actually doubled the size of the debt that ALL of the other presidents before him have borrowed. I am sure that there is more but that is all that I can think of off hand. I pray that Pierre's little boy is not our Obama."

5079,"Parliamentary Rights of Private Members. As someone who served in three Parliaments, I firmly believe that you're wrong, Margaret. My comment is made as someone who was very active as a Private Member during my terms in Parliament. Our tradition is that the business of the House is partitioned into 'government business' and 'Private Members business'. The former are subject to strict protocols of party discipline and the latter are not. Every MP has the right (and the responsibility) to press his / her personal views or the views of his / her constituents in Private Members business for discussion. The Private Member does not, of course, have the right to ensure that any such proposal is voted upon and approved in the House. While I understand that some outside the House would prefer that some topics never be debated in the House, doing so risks the rights and responsibilities the underlie our Parliamentary democracy. Canadian Parliamentary democracy is fundamentally different from the way the US Congress operates. There, the party leaders can ensure that a bill or a motion to limit the size of gun magazines never comes to the floor. Same for a bill to impose background checks. Those restrictions might sound fine if you oppose such legislation; but what if you support the measures? On balance, however uncomfortable having such measures discussed on the floor might be, I feel our traditional Parliamentary democracy is superior in serving the Canadian public."

We know Trudeau is breathlessly awaiting his chance to raise the GST and punish working people with Carbon Taxes. Legalized marijuana, should be terrific for productivity and public safety. Oh yeah, don't forget a war on oil and gas as he flies everywhere by private jet. The rest of us are just trying to get to work in the morning. Then again, Trudeau doesn't represent the working class, he's counting on support from the non-working class."
9507,"Minor point, but the Tragically Hip tried everything they could to crack the US market but never could. Their signal lack of success in the US market is one of the key reasons they're such a 'Canadian' band. We tend to view success in the US with suspicion."
4250,"We all make choices in life. Unfortunately, sometimes they are life-altering and tragic ones. Some of us value the gift of life more than others and some of us squander that gift, regardless of health, fame or fortune. Drug addiction is a terrible problem. But that first purchase and first hit is a choice. We all know the potential consequences of choosing hard drugs, and for most people, this is a sufficient deterrent. The notion of personal agency appears obsolete in today's world. We are not expected to take responsibility for our choices anymore. If we have a problem, we expect governments and/or society at large to assist us. As such, we are attempting to regulate just about every aspect of human activity in such a way that our individual and economic freedom has been gradually eroded and greatly diminished."
8854,"The Olympics, , are about patriotism, not “sexual preference.”"
365,"Great article. The lack of character, the lack of compassion and the lack of the very qualities that make humans human is very apparent in Ford's detractors. You have to wonder what creates and sustains such hatred. Very strange and very sad."
10784,What made us fat? We ate too much and exercised too little.
1130,"I love, love, love these kinds of Conservative projections, and fully encourage them to continue. Yup, Trudeau was the angry, sure, he was the hyper-partisan. Yes, please keep believing that he is doomed to fail and that your 'conservative principles' will inevitably win you the next election. In the end this is all about conservatives telling themselves that they don't have to change anything about their party. The longer they believe that and keep losing elections, the better Canada will be."
11288,"Jokers always apologize because they need to do it to continue joking around. The Speaker - He can keep quiet but must realize that the rest of the country expects him to be looking after their interest. As for the rest of the conservatives on election day ,My member of parliament is in the opposition I cannot do much but those other Canadians who have some of these people who were laughing as their MP's may want to remember it when they vote . Sending our troops on harms way should be a serious matter and we need to have a unified approach to it."
28,I agree that Hillary Clinton is more qualified to administer than Trump. In fact she is probably one of the most qualified candidates in a long time. The problem is America needs a change. It needs a revolution. It needs to clean house of corruption. We had Reagan and we survived and he was not qualified. I agree that Trump is an unpredictable candidate but new presidents post election are never the same as they were while electioneering. They surround themselves with advisors who will keep them and us sane. With Hillary Clinton we will continue this constant international conflict and I am tired of this childish admonishing - be like us and we will like you and if we don't like you we will do our best to change you. Accusing Russia of trying to undermine US Democracy is absurd. Why doesn't GM publish Putin's statement (verbatim) on the subject of American election?

1074,"Just vote NDP and enjoy laughing at Pretty Boy Prentice and his gang of Cons, and the Globe and it's corporate editorial lackeys. What joy there is in sweet revenge, it's time to make the incompetent and corrupt Cons pay the price for taking the hard working taxpaying Albertans for granted for so long. Goodbye and good riddance to Prentice and his gang of fear mongering Cons!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
11458,"Mr. Trump's refusal to release his tax returns is very telling. If this 'successful' businessman was actually successful, he would be happy to release the proof. As has been stated by others, I believe Mr. Trump is lying about his gross or net worth and doesn't want his supporters to find out how big a fraud he really is."
9666,The alt-right maybe the only hope Western civilization has left . The barbarians are at the gate .
210,"The York University train of events illustrates that finding an optimum balance between worthy values is no easy task in all cases. It is true that some of us, reviewing this case, will come down strongly on one side or the other but the fact remains that no neat formula or process exists in a few cases like this whereby persons of good will can all agree upon the balance between contending rights that is most appropriate. For what it's worth I would argue that both Professor Grayson and York University each addressed the situation they faced with good will and intelligence and that each tried their best to weigh how the respective rights and dignity of all the persons involved could be best respected. Further, the fact that the Human Rights Code does not provide a ready-made answer in this situation does not negate the value of that Code as a framework within which to strive to resolve difficult cases like this. The truth, arguably, illustrated by this story as a whole is that morals, ethics and legal reasoning are processes rather than fixed outcomes. The point is that we must try to do the right thing realizing that discerning what the best outcome should be is sometimes difficult and that other, no better or worse than ourselves, might honestly come to a different conclusion in the circumstances - and also that the very effort to arrive at the best solution (even if 'best' is murky) is a worthy exercise."
3033,Utter nonsense. Expatriate voting rights are a relatively new invention in Canada. The first general election in which expatriates (other than members of the Armed Forces and foreign service) could vote was 1997. The statutory limit on the exercise of these rights has always been five years--notwithstanding the lower court ruling that has been rendered null by the Court of Appeal.
8040,"It is time time for Stephen Harper to do the right thing and declare himself God of this world. All nations will bow to him. He is beyond Christ. To even say his is God is wrong, he is so much beyond God. I am sure his supporters in Western Canada will support this. To hell with God we have Stephen Harper."
5121,"In every case of deficit the governments of the time pretend it's because of bad economies and less tax revenue. Klein always balanced the books and Alberta became Canada's most prosperous, envied and resented province because of it. After the Reform Party took the same philosophy to Ottawa the Liberal Party was forced to balance the books after near bankruptcy under the Progressive Conservatives. Well, here we are years later. We elected a government pretending to be conservative that behaves like liberals. They REFUSE to stop spending. The can't balance the books. We're stacking on the debt again, and even with a comfortable majority they are cowering from slashing spending. Alberta and Canada needs more Ralph Kleins."
4429,"I sent the following email to the 'foundation', to Harper, to my MP, and to Parks Canada. Only Parks Canada has replied, to say that they are gathering opinions.'This is absolutely beyond description, and I will do everything I can to fight it.This is a National Park—it belongs to all the people of Canada. It is not available for commercial ventures. The geology of this particular area is unique. It is a complete violation of Parks Canada’s mandate, and any concern about the environment, and preservation of the site for opportunities for future study, to even think of something like this being placed there. The statue is grotesque. It has nothing to do with Canadian values, tradition, or history. The commercial aspects of something that purports to be a memorial of the sacrifice of Canadian men and women, with parking lots, a restaurant, a gift shop, and other commercial facets, is obscene. This is a twisted, deceptive, and manipulative attempt to frame a commercial venture, a violation of Canadian space, as a memorial to Canadian fighters; it is nothing of the sort, and to claim that it is is unspeakable. You ought to be hanging your collective heads in shame. And to Parks Canada, and our Parliamentarians: this MUST not be allowed to proceed. It is absolutely outrageous.'"
6878,"Gee, I thought most of those poster trashing Baird would have been happy enough that he left....."
2367,"Don't forget that Junior skipped out of parliament without talking to reporters and left Marc Garneau holding the bag. Junior, like Ben Mulroney, is better suited to hosting Entertainment Tonight, or whatever it is Mulroney does. In the end Junior is little more than a young, foppish, silver-spooned, melodramatic, phoney popinjay, who is in waayyyyyy over his head."

It could be a man or a different woman then the one who is supposed to be there. I think it should be banned all together. I think our Country is letting to many things slide. All in the name of Freedom of Religion!!! Please. When I was young I was able to tell someone Merry Christmas. I cant even do that anymore... I have to say Happy Holidays cuz I ' might offend them!

3380,I was considering moving to small Town Ontario until I checked out the property tax situation. Sure you can buy homes cheaper but the cost of running them is just as high or higher than the city suburbs. This is due in large part to huge dollars paid to fire and police with less population to cover. I will be staying put.
11795,I very much like Bob's logic.'I believe it comes down to the fact that Canada has a more informed citizenry 'That means the uninformed Americans like his comments. I wonder why?

7309,"The OPP tactics makes me want to vote PC. It used to be public servants were paid a bit less but had job security ,good benefits, regular work hours, and a great pension plan. Now they have salaries better than the private sector and everything else. Time for a reality check public service employees . If you worked in the private sector you would work a lot harder and more hours."
4652,"'A coward: One who, in a perilous emergency, thinks with his legs.' Ambrose Bierce. The Globe editorial board -- aka the marketing department for the 1 per cent in Canada -- has once again thought with their legs. After the outrage the paper generated by backing Hudak in the Ontario provincial election, these conniving flacks have found a hilarious, albeit convenient, out this time. George Brown would be rolling in his grave."
4252,"Indeed a disease suggests a process beyond one's control. But that fits with PSH. His first round of heroin addiction in his 20's caused a permanent brain rewiring which made relapse very easy and swift. The presence of physiological change that results in permanent dysfunction is what defines disease. I don't see how you can argue this is not a disease. As Ms. Wente points out, plenty of diseases are caused by poor lifestyle choices, such as diabetes, heart disease, herpes, etc. The difference with addiction is that the physiological state makes the drug use behaviour inescapable. That's not true for eating fatty foods or having unprotected sex. So in a way, addiction deserves more of our sympathy than these other diseases, not less."

2513,".From the aericle; Attawapiskat, Chief Spence's community, is subject to severe flooding, given its location on the James Bay plain, but it refused to consider moving farther upriver or near Timmins, where there might be employment opportunities. Bingo/thus the problem....................."
7306,"When it comes to public funding, transparency is a 'must-have' part of the way of doing business. While Spence and her spokespeople attempt to deflect criticism by dismissing the importance of the audit, it speaks to a fundamental issue that the rest of Canada does have concern for - The taxpayers who paid the $104M to Attawapiskat are owed an explanation! Spence and her people need to consider the option of making full disclosure, no matter how ugly the truth might become. The alternative is an RCMP investigation that will certainly get much uglier than anyone, especially Spence, wants. The PM, when he meets with the AFN and other Aboriginal leaders on Friday, will certainly be aware of what Canadians want to see, accountability for public money that is given to native communities and a measure of transparency. Anything less and the rest of Canada needs to start a Spend No More movement. Let's all watch the hockey game Saturday night."

126,"'Mr. Trudeau isn’t against pipelines. But he isn’t exactly for them, either. What he’s for is doing the right thing. Unlike the ancien régime, he is determined to obtain what’s called a social licence. This means that he will bring everyone to the table and listen to their views, and that all decisions will be based on facts and evidence. “Getting our resources to market … means doing it responsibly for communities, for indigenous peoples and for the environment,” Mr. Trudeau says. Who could disagree with that?'I disagree because its an impossible subject to achieve any consensus. If there is legal grounds for a pipe line, build it and protect it. Thats it, talking to crying babies is impossible."
9464,Tony has yet to understand why Harper led the CPC to a stunning defeat. Tony is simply rehashing the same Conservative policies that we rejected by nearly 70% of voters With this kind of empty approach the Conservatives will have a very hard time rising from their ashes and attract more than their ideological base.
1246,The sky will not fall. Time to let another party take the lead. It will be an eternal argument for the other party to have no experience. It would actually be good and healthy for more than one party to have governing experience. That way Alberta may actually flourish for real.
10052,"In a nutshell, anyone with a modicum of intelligence will see behind the spin and lies of Mr. Harper and quickly surmise that he is not fit to govern this country, or any other country for that matter. He is solely responsible for the worst economic performance in at least the last 20 years or more depending hon how you look at the data. If this doesn’t wake up the electorate, nothing will."

When you live in a free society, and welcome foreign investment this will happen. The next we will hear is all the complaints when the bubble bursts and they wind up with homes that are under water. Stop buying and the merry-go-round will stop."

The spokeswoman acknowledges having read an open letter from a TO Cst. who is gay and who welcomes the police marching as this affirms him but for BLM it does not matter for no police public presence is acceptable. BLM is really missing the point of the by definition inclusive nature of the PRIDE concept, they seem to not only be bullies but adolescent."

4052,"This entire editorial is based upon a false premise: That Harper handled our economy well. Harper is a man who denied and missed the recession. In fact, the Globe endorsed him in 2008 when he was promising (via Flaherty) that there would be 'no deficit on my watch'. The recession required Stimulus. Harper prorogued then co-opted Stimulus and spent like a drunken sailor. Furthermore, he spent unwisely. Short-term projects in CPC ridings - no long term vision that would benefit Canada longer term. A big fiscal hole which bought Harper a majority in 2011 (again, the Globe endorsing him). Harper's majority was a mess of flawed legislation, court fights, Senate scandals, and fudged books. This editorial submits that the other two parties have economic platforms that do not deviate very much from Harper. So if it IS about the economy then all three parties are similar too as the Globe and Mail admits. Harper does NOT deserve another mandate. The CPC is Harper. IF Walmsley and the Globe Editorial Board had any integrity or courage they would not have published this hot mess of an endorsement."

1080,"Except he is the leader, and he IS the party, and he isn't going anywhere if they win even a minority. So, based on your own comments, 'he has undone himself and his party with a narrowness of vision and a meanness of spirit on a host of issues, from voting rights to crime and punishment to respect for science to respect for the courts', how the heck do the Conservatives deserve another mandate? Shocking!! And by the way, his record on the economy isn't that great, and all of his boutique tax credits are rubbish! They are called buying votes - great politics, bad policy. We would have all been better off with a reduced income tax rate across the board instead of all his b.s. Most of those tax credits are only worth something for people with money to spend in the first place. I look forward to seeing them take a drubbing on Monday."

Where should we start closing stations? Maybe your neighbourhood doesn't need one or maybe the one in your parents neighbourhood should be closed. You decide.
2035,'... for Western countries to reinforce the instruments of global governance.' Yup - Finally an admission that that's exactly what the Heinbeckers and his ilk of the world really desire. It's somewhat heartening to know that we were right all along after years of being mocked by North American leftist media elites that such talk was a view advanced mostly from the supposed 'lunatic right wing conspiracy theorists'.Here's another: Socialist/Leftists/Communists/Liberal Party/NDP don't give a sh%T about Canada as a nation state and would prefer one big miserable earth ball.

I get this QUITE OFTEN from people who work in more liberal industries and was reprimanded about being too integrated/Anglo (why? Because I wore white when I married?). Please note that these comments DO NOT come from relatives."

231,"If you don't believe that the ever increasing carbon concentration in our atmosphere is, and will destroy our environment, then please don't read on. Keep your head in the (tar) sand. Instead, the 60's called, and want your confirmation that cigarettes are good for your health. Do you accept that since 1997 every month of the year has had a new global high temperature? That drought, flooding, polar vortex, super storms, migration of pests northward, reduction in ice caps, and a myriad of other events/trends that 1000's of scientists confirm threaten our health just may be due to the fact that the earth really isn't one big toxic waste site that we can continue to go to dump. If you think carbon is a problem, you will be prepared to pay more in tax or higher priced products, to deal with it. Why would you think we need to wait until all the other countries in the world have sorted out their emissions? Canada will be one of the worst off countries when climate change gets into full swing. Instead we could use our talents to lead the world in innovation."
10417,"Sorry, but this tax is a boondoggle and way for government to collect more money from taxpayers. As for the necessity of curbing carbon emissions, well if you completely support all the climate science, Canada's numbers in this area are so miniscule as to make this big expensive effort almost ridiculous (except for the boondoggle of course).If there's an international accord and I see the real carbon emission culprits (based on the projections of the climate change model) paying their proportionate share (i.e. China and India), I might feel differently about this. But in a country like Canada, which has minimal emissions and is made viable only by the fuel that heats our homes, the sound and fury over this issues is laughable. By all means let's look for better sources of energy - but not at the expense of taxing Canadians' ability to survive here."

10422,"I wish the author well in her quest for justice, however, in my long experience viewing the actions of the US there is nothing in their history to show me that Trump won't try to step on citizens, or their rights. It may very well be that Trump is the President who will hasten the second American revolution rather than addressing the concerns of the people. Time will tell, but if he tries to do what he says he is going to, then I suppose as Canadians we have a responsibility to go down there and set things right, by any means necessary."
1732,Get rid of party members like Clement and start over. This party has been so bad that they made people vote for Liberals in Ottawa and the NDP in Alberta. Enough said.
249,"Ludicrous. First, this is what happens now in politics: the opposition hammers the government on things that have very little to do with anything. The Liberals did it to the Tories and now the Tories will do it to the Liberals. Another manifestation of the overall diminishment of our political process. Second, and others have pointed this out, is that the birther movement alleges President Obama was not born in the US which would preclude him from being POTUS. This is a question of which foreign country Ms Monsef happened to be born in. In the Obama case it was tinfoil hat stuff with constitutional consequences. In the Monsef case its simply banal. Finally, this article is actually really depressing because it is clear that the author and some other fellow travellers to compare this to the Birther mess because Canada lacks sufficient home-grown scandal. A hackneyed version of putting words in peoples' mouths then calling them out for it."
6191,Anyone who understands marketing and advertising knows that image and impression are most valuable. Reality doesn't even matter if perceptions are set. Trudeau and his handlers are good at this kind of promotion but they were certainly helped by Harper's lack of it or his even anti-promotion. Almost anyone could have done better after Harper and the pent up yearning for the return of the Canada everyone counted on was bursting at the seams. But full credit to Trudeau and his team for bringing Canada back from the dead.

Yes and that includes the now overripe porkchop known as Mike Duffy, the bag of hammers who calls herself LeBreton, the embarrassment that slithered off centre stage after resigning as Public Safety Minister and the caste of hundreds of partisen leaches who collectively make up the PMO. He hired each and every one of them in a vain effort to retain his own power base."
10211,"I've noticed that what used to be cited as 'Global Warming' in environmental discussions has been replaced in recent years by the term 'Climate Change.' This in itself is a PR move - a rebranding to move focus away from solely a rising temperature issue and towards other aspects of extreme weather. Of course, 'climate change' is simply a tautology: through out the millions of years of earth's history, climate has always been changing, its never been static. The real question is 'how much of it is due to human activity?' While the science cannot say definitively how much, it does confirm that we are contributing to it in some fashion and that should be enough to warrant us to continue being environmentally conscious regardless of what the PR machines are doing."
81,"Who cares whether there is a game plane.. As long as the Prime Minister and his fellow Ministers are communicating, and utilizing the Civil Service that's fine with me; its sure a lot better than being advised of sudden government policy decisions from someone 10,000 miles away. This author is just splitting the issue. Now one can assume the reason Conservatives don't want to talk to the media is because they are conservative and cannot handle change, complexities and divergent trends."

1315,"The US political system appears to be so polarized that is it in paralysis, unable to move i any direction. Despite the Harper government's best efforts, the Canadian system is not yet so polarized and may never be. This calls into question the supposed parallels between Obama and Trudeau. I find the analysis facile and unconvincing; nor does it address the fact that in each case, the defeated governments had richly earned the anger and distrust that led the electorates to turf them out. As for 'post partisanship', if it means that Trudeau will govern for the good of the whole country and not just for his base, I'm all for it and can only hope that every successor government will do the same."

I'm reading a lot of people making the argument that its a human rights violation and so this university shouldn't be recognized in the wider community -- but it's a choice to go there and something that students consent to pledging towards when they make that choice. No one is stopping gay people from going there, they're more than welcome to. And if they don't want to go to a law school that asks them not to engage in pre-marital sex that isn't with a man and a woman, there's plenty of other options for them to take. Using the human rights argument is just a cheap way to try and assert your own political view on someone else. The human right is freedom from persecution as a result of your sexual orientation; the existence of a school that doesn't recognize gay marriage for religious reasons, protection of which is another human right, isn't even close to persecution."

557,"And not a word here about Trudeau having his own personal photographer following him around EVERYWHERE, almost 24/7. Anything to retain power, right? - to say nothing of the expense and obscene vanity. Explain that one away reasonably."
5017,"Uh, doesn't Bardish Chagger (cabinet member for tourism & small business) qualify as black? Or is she not black enough in the eyes of the writer? This whole thing seems petty. Ms. Chagger didn't campaign on her ethnic background, so I honestly have no idea what her original ethnicity is (mixed Carribean? half Indian? no idea). And that's probably the way it should be."

8134,"This is sadly true. Family reunification laws in Canada are the reason I'm living in Europe with my husband. He's fluent in both official languages and has a high paying engineering job he could easily transfer to Canada, but because he would not pass the medical exam, we're staying put in the alps. There are no alternatives with private insurance in Canada, which we would gladly pay given the situation.. It's too bad there are no properly regulated private insurers that don't exempt pre-existing conditions in Canada. Ironically, because of NAFTA and my engineering degree, we can easily move to the US as it's easily a matter of a transfer for him and I'm welcome in the US as a Canadian with an engineering degree. Too bad the rules can't transfer to Canada."

3451,"It's nauseating to read how rabidly glib the morally inept, self professed 'intelligentsia' continue to be. Who really appointed you? How tasteless and divisive to to try to deride and silence Trump supporters by branding them Nazi's when you, you sad lot, are employing the same tactics they did: demonize and suppress large groups of people just because they disagree with you. That you are trying to ride a tragic historical fact to advance your smug stance is just further evidence that the ethically challenged flatulence exploding across the front pages of papers will continue mourning the fact that their heroine prophet of limitless greed, cronyism, and outright profiteering on the backs of the poor has not managed to sell the Oval Office after she had her go at the State Department. What a joke of a gang. Seriously, what an embarrassing lot."
4283,MACKINNONJWMAnd so it should be. Those 'mandarins' as you call them (where does that come from?) are the people who actually know what they're talking about. THEY are the ones who your local used car dealer turned MP looks to for the facts. At least that was the case until Mr. Harper piled on us and said the rabble knows best. Well the rabble doesn't know best. That's why they are the used car salesman from Pinky Saskatchewan and not scientists. They may be experts in the field of changing spark plus in that old Chevy but they have no business deciding what the supreme court should do about the legality of a women's dress code or whether a nuclear power plant is safe or whether Canada is using due diligence in a war zone 3 thousand miles away from his back yard BBQ. That's why we employ a dentist to fix our teeth or qualified pilots to fly our planes. That's why we employ those 'mandarins.' They tell us to cross the street when the light is green and NOT just whenever we want to.

10092,"Too funny. The professional Quebec handlers are getting their little engines all revved up.It's been a bad decade for this lot: sentiment for separation has been polling at near historic lows, certainly lower than during the previous 4 decades. And of course, most galling of all, it happened during the tenure of a bumpkin PM from, of all places, Alberta. How, oh how, could this be?Well, it be.Or now apparently, it used to be.Look at this quote from Jeffy: 'Organizing a referendum against the leadership of Mr. Harper, an easy, unpopular target, might be very tempting.'How soon some forget. When Harper came to power, the Bloc had a carefully laid trap all prepared: remember the 'Quebec as a nation' angst? In one brilliant speech, perhaps the highlight of Harper's entire time in office (and I agree there haven't been many), Harper laid out the facts: the policy was that the 'Quebecois' were a distinct 'nation' within an indivisible Canada. Game, set and match Harper. The Bloquistes were left massaging their political testicles for months. They never made the mistake of underestimating Harper again. The Bloc faded away, and the PQ was left wandering in the wilderness. Ahhh, but now at last there is light. The professional Quebec handlers are having below the waist feelings not experienced in many years. Jeffy is one of those. We'll see Jeffy, we'll see. Maybe the universe will once again start unfolding as your ilk thinks it should, with never ending hand wringing about Quebec, and the only question being the extent of appeasement. We'll see."

5515,"The Globe is now endorsing the Alberta Conservatives, but also telling the voters to 'ideally' make it a minority government !I think the Globe told us Ontarians to make it a minority government in our last election, which many thought was quite illogical. Can the Globe please tell us voters how to make sure it becomes a minority government ?Unless we canvass every other voter in the province, how are we to make sure this happens ? Sarcasm intended. What nonsense - you say to vote for a party but make sure they do not get a majority !The Globe seems to have a problem with logic and reality based decision making. Who writes these editorials ?"
11481,"'A rose by any other name is still a rose'If these 'gender neutral' labels still have somewhat of a gender specific application then they are pointless. School should not be a place of dogmatic social engineering. Does anyone else find it odd that the two board members who voted against the motion to pass these pronouns were kicked out of a committee for tolerance? Apparently, as with everything 'progressive', there is only tolerance for people and ideas that fully agree with everything that 'progressive' dogma dictates."
488,"For a different perspective on the VW scandal, consider this; it won't be the last, and similar events should start to occur more frequently. The technology involved in sensing and measuring 'stuff' is constantly becoming cheaper, more accurate, and broader in scope. The current system is built to reward exploitation of externalities for the economic benefit of the few, and that system depends on the ability to obfuscate the size and cost of those externalities. As the people affected ( us ) become more able to measure and quantify just what is happening, life should become more 'interesting'.What I find amazing is that this this information has been public for over a year, and is only now hitting media saturation. Think about it; every model of capital valuation I know of says that VW shares should have been crushed a year ago; at least, the shorts should have bloomed. This isn't even insider knowledge, it was public."
7055,"Silencing behaviour is silencing behaviour, if you can not communicate with your identity intact there's a problem. It is a mind blowing idea that there could be more than two genders or the ability to switch them. Some moments I get it; some moments I do not. There is a difference between fighting to create space for a new idea and attempting to re-impose old ones with a history of destruction like theocracy, various delusions of national virtue etc. Universities are now being marketed as centers of innovation; the idea of innovation is that it can go anywhere. IF a person had communicated that they preferred to be labelled by pronoun or an identity, so long as it was not fraudulent, respect / comply. By that standard, if I professed indigenous, feminine or religious identities, the audience would have the right and perhaps moral obligation to challenge those assertions. I get annoyed by the aggressive lefties but not compared to seeing a woman denied facial communication."

7346,"Well that was inflammatory! How do you expect people to react if you propose to build others up by tearing them down? Society at large is not racist, sexist or xenophobic but until the 1% provides a path to allow minorities, feminism, and all the races to share equally without it coming at the cost of another segment we will not stop fighting amongst ourselves and that is exactly how this new class of the 1% wants it."
6019,"Anyone who thinks Trump is remotely qualified to be president should read some of the things that he said and advocates. Saudi Arabia with nuclear weapons, no problem. Ban 1.5 billion Muslims from the US until 'we figure out what's going on.' (In his case, that would be never.) Anyway read it if you want a good laugh.

7017,"Quoted from The Guardian: 'In the 11 years since he became leader of the country’s Conservatives, the party has been fined for breaking electoral rules, and various members of Team Harper have been caught misleading parliament, gagging civil servants, subverting parliamentary committees, gagging scientists, harassing the supreme court, gagging diplomats, lying to the public, concealing evidence of potential crime, spying on opponents, bullying and smearing. Harper personally has earned himself the rare rebuke of being found to be in contempt of his parliament.' Note they rightly call the Harper conservatives A TEAM. I've just cancelled my subscription to the G&M ---- shoddy journalism and shameless corporate self interest."
3455,The author talks about Israel as if it's a country full of Israelis.. there are 1.6 million Arabs who live in Israel.....they live in a uneasy peace surrounded by the wall... I lived and worked for a year on a moshav almost exactly where the author vacationed... one blistering hot day an Arab construction worker came to my door asking for water.. I gave him a large glass of water and was severely reprimanded by the moshav leader who said WE don't talk to Arabs....this is the country of Israel..

8282,I believe accepting a drink from a man (woman) is a form of contract that will lead to sex. I saw a TV Commercial last night where the women only got excited about being with the man after he offered her a drink. IF she accepts more drinks that is a contract for more sexual advances leading to sex. Am I wrong here or is it that although women make as much money now as men (except for the few elite alpha males that run massive companies) that they are just taking money from the men (fraud) and are playing a game of 'want their cake and eat it too' instead of paying their own way.
7400,"This is an urgent message going out to all like minded opponents of that awful Prime Minister Harper. Chief Spence needs your support. She is facing a massive shortfall in the number of receipts needed to clean up her books. Please, check your wallets, your purses and any places around the house and send any receipts to Chief Spence. Receipts for housing supplies, tools, buildings, etc gracefully accepted. Please don't send receipts for large SUVs, fancy meals, and travel to nice places. We already have enough of those."

11415,"In Bedford vs. Canada the government relied on witnesses from the US who were funded in the Bush era to travel to countries considering lifting prostitution prohibitions. Their research, as found by Justice Himel, is not up to court standards but done by advocates of prohibition. We see ngos set up in Canada since 2010, around the time the Court of Appeal decided in favour of relief to prostitutes, which are very centered on mischaracterizing the case and fear-mongering. MP Joy Smith has jumped on the bandwagon and started her own NGO which also seeks to discredit the many supporters of Bedford vs. Canada. We must ask about the funding both domestic and international of these organizations which actively seek to influence the courts and use 'research' discredited by our own courts. See Justice Himel's decision."

4769,"They picked the wrong women to run for President, it's as simple as that. Elizabeth Warren would have been a whole different story."
4077,"I agree that an inquiry would duplicate work already done at a needless cost of time and money. However, Mr. Harper's position that the deaths should be dealt with on an individual basis as crimes is at best short-sighted and at worst yet another example of his ignorance of or disdain for the sociological roots of aboriginal issues. As others have commented, we know why First Nations' people are suffering, we need to move beyond police investigations and put what we know to work."

2704,I agree 100%. Didn't Newfoundland also achieve this?
3034,Sorry Sheena but when people who immigrate to this country want to try to recreate their home land they should not be surprised if the run into some some push back from people who have lived here all their lives. You knew that you were coming to a pluralistic society. Most Canadians find the niqab offensive. If you want to feel accepted you must be willing to change and adapt. Why do you always take the view that it is the rest of Canada who must change to acomadate Islam?
6285,"Perhaps not 'all oil extraction is inherently evil, environmentally unpardonable and economically backward,' but realistically about 80% of known fossil-fuel reserves need to be left in the ground. Those which are most carbon-intensive (like tarsands bitumen) should be among those kept in the ground. This is simply logical. Furthermore, transporting diluted bitumen (as opposed to oil) poses special risks. It is much harder to clean up in waterways and may also be more corrosive when if flows through pipelines. So, Energy East really should not go ahead."
8185,"I have a feeling if a charismatic, right of centre mayoral candidate were to also campaign on a fiscal tightening platform, Fords numbers would crumble. My prediction is that the video will appear, he makes anti-immigrant comments, and that will be the last straw holding up his base."
7257,"An acknowledgement from Ms. Wente on climate change but she continues to keep her head in the sand about it's cause. Sad that the flooding has happened but it couldn't have been more ironic that it happened in Alberta and car centric Toronto. Time to make some major changes on how we live. We have to embrace rapid and communal transit, higher taxes to pay for it and environmentally friendly mining of oil."
6015,"Trump wears his emotions on his sleeve revealing his reactionary personality and a vulnerability rarely seen in presidential candidates and almost never seen in career politicians. It's both appealing and ugly in a way due to its naked honesty but once in power it is very likely Trump would be limited by the checks and balances of the American political system. Hillary is just the opposite, the coy emotionless politician that hides her true intent with empty rhetoric, fake feigned smiles clearly beholden to the money that finances her campaign, unwilling to let honesty get in the way of her ambitions and image: the ultimate symbol of the hallow status quo politician. At least with Trump, like Bernie, you know who your getting and it is very likely to be a new approach that puts the status quo at risk."
9427,"Margaret Wente ends her column, 'What a shabby, crummy story. No one wins. Everybody loses. I’m sorry for them all, and for us.'I agree with the 'shabby, crummy' story (although, perhaps, the man's supposed victims might disagree.)About the rest of the comment, disagree. I guess I'm part of 'us,' but Ms. Wente can keep her sympathy. I don't feel that I've suffered at all from this lamentable state of affairs (no pun intended.) Never listened to the man's show. Didn't know what a 'Ghomeshi' even was until the news broke. (Who?) I'll survive and do okay, I think. Was doing OK not knowing about him! Like a lot of other folks, I hunch. Next..."
6634,"It's a language thing. Mr Harper is concerned about a 'principalled' foreign policy, one that is geared towards protecting the principal (capital preservation) and guaranteeing the interest payments. Or, he talks through his hat."

164,"It was a dismal, stumble-bum of a first week. Two years to go to the next election. Two more years of this disappointing performance will consign the Liberals to the dustbin of Canadian history - right beside the Social Credit."
3122,"SHORT OF GENOCIDE or other mass crimes against humanity, it is morally, politically and legally wrong for foreign nations to attack one of the sides in a country's internal conflict. That might seem like a callous principle when you hear of deaths and atrocities, but the principle is as sound as solid gold. Morally? It's impossible to intervene militarily in a conflict without killing innocent people. And if you intervene via indiscriminate means, such as bombing, you will kill many innocents. Politically? Only the people who have lived all their lives in the country understand it. They're the ones who must deal with the reality and come to terms. Foreign intervention favouring one side or the other skews the situation in ways that are guaranteed to fail in the future. Legally? Every nation on the planet is a member of the United Nations, and has signed a binding agreement not to attack any other nation, without UN Security Council authorization. Every time Canada, the US or another nation drops a bomb in Iraq it is violating international law. When one country attacks another country, then that's the time to think of military involvement. But when a conflict is contained within a nation, and even though their may be loss of life, outside nations must not take part it in short of a catastrophe of Rwanda-like proportions. End of story."

6337,"My 90 year old mother who lives in a small village on the prairies is concerned about terrorists. Muslim terrorists. Luckily another little old lady in her New Horizons group suggested she be more concerned about being struck by lightning, as this is far more likely to happen out there on the bald prairie. Another friend said... well...now we know why the RCMP were not arresting all those bands of terrorists reputedly engaging in conspiracy....not close enough to the election. One arrest per week. Im reminded... of 1984... the novel....when its mentioned that in the world of that novel....there were constant wars and rumours of wars... television filled with violence and fire....deliberately done by the governments to keep Winston Smith and everyone else's eyes off economic problems. However, as has been pointed out, while this is a heaven-sent issue for Harper et al....well....its still not a major issue for the electorate. But will it pull that extra 4 or 5 percent that Harper... and their superior wedge issues and get out the vote machine......needs to cling to office. Cause one thing for sure. Le Dauphin seems to have stalled. And I must say. I can't understand why we dont realize that ISIS and all this other madness is a direct or indirect result of the American invasion of Iraq... and a few years before that....the West selling weapons of mass destruction and poison gas to our then allies Iraq to attack Iran. And the endless war in Afghanistan. Bombing Libya. Propping up a murderous military regime in Egypt. Letting Assad get away with mass murder. Why do we in the west think that our armies can go and shoot up these countries, create millions of refugees, bomb them to smithereens, prop up every corrupt and rotten dictator... from the Saudi Princes to Quadaffi when he came onside and shared the oil... how can Canada... when our position on the middle east is so reactionary and one sided... how can we expect this stuff to go on...and there wont be a flashback? Violence and threats of violence and fear only begets violence and threats of violence and fear."

1207,"Mr Lewis is right about one thing: the least controversial part of the Manifesto is the statement that Canada has to wean itself from the use of fossil fuels. This is demanded by our signature on the Paris Accord and it is demanded by the best science today. You do not reduce greenhouse emissions by increasing emissions (even if the carbon intensity is theoretically reduced a bit). Canada has to invest in alternative energy sources and the infrastructure that this implies. And yes, this will generate more jobs and more longer-term prosperity than the sooty system we have now. It is politically painful for governments in Edmonton, Vancouver, and Ottawa to admit it, but sooner or later they will have to come on board to the fact that the fossil fuel era is rapidly winding down."
8307,"Some posters are attacking parents who don't want their children to be exposed to the new sex ed curriculum (in many cases because of what they see as the promotion of a 'homosexual agenda') .They are quite vociferous attacks based on the parents being backward, needing to adapt to canadian values that they should be brought of the stone age etc etc. However the same posters often support the use of the niqab even though that is seen by others as a repressive, misogynistic symbol embraced by those raised with very different cultural values who have failed to adapt etc etc. What a topsy-turvy world!"
1244,"98-pound weakling or no, I think the US is wisely measuring the potential response from Russia and China. Those two rather powerful countries - which in stark and embarrassing contrast to our own can back up their positions with more than the Stern Daughter of the Voice of God routine - have every reason to be wary of any further Western incursion in the Near East, and may possibly have informed the US through quieter, less shrill, back channels that Syria is indeed a 'red line' that is crossed at great peril. Not that any pandering, name calling commentator could appreciate that."
202,"He does in fact have an obligation to not involve himself in the political process. There is a long standing directive that is renewed every 4 years stating that members of the justice department should not take actions that could be viewed as political in nature within 60 days of an election. He chose instead to ignore this and for what. They did not even know the contents of the emails and given the prior precedent of the recommendation that he made a few months ago it is unlikely that his conclusion will change. Therefore, he could end up handing the election to Trump and costing the Democrats many down ballot seats and then announce once the investigation is concluded that there was no change in the FBIs position on Clinton's activities. That to me is a huge gamble with the electoral process and the reputation of the FBI."
5864,"Unfortunately all the social housing the city provides is for addicts. Nothing for working people, such as nurses, teachers, clerks, etc."
7652,Shocking! Thank you for this article. Please pursue this story. Who made the decisions that led to this injustice? Was the court delay a result of a failing of the prison system or the court system?

11172,"Margaret, the engineers ignore them because they dismiss them accurately as angry, unhappy people . I don't know what you mean when you say the others have 'taking over ' when the engineers look up but the concentration is clearly in certain departments/faculties. They haven't taken over the engineering , business or medical schools. These schools are focused on the future, a la ...jobs.

10134,"This editorial is so filled with vitriol and hate by anyone's definition that it could have been written by Trump himself. In fact, Trump is too politically correct to write something like this. This piece may very well be one of the nastiest editorials ever written against any single person and any nation's citizens in the history of the G&M in 'modern times'. What makes something like this possible in what I would assume is among the top 5 media outlets in Canada, its National newspaper, is anti-American bigotry that ingrained in Canadian culture. I'll bet no one, from Putin to Saddam Hussein to Idi Amin and their followers were ever described in the terms used in this article."
4771,Does Trudeau have a hair-stylist / makeup-artist / man-girdle-tightener on staff?
6416,"Why? 1. Because people scream that countries be pressured when anyone with even the most tenuous ties to Canada gets in trouble there. 2. If you limit your contact to countries that have any sense of democracy or human rights, you are down to 40 of 200 in the world. 3. That was tried - with China - and everyone howled how Canada was being shut out of the opportunity. Of course, when that was changed everyone cried it was sacrificing principle. Really, Simpson is becoming little better than the howlers who complain that when Harper travels, he embarrases them, but if he doesn't go, 'why isn't Harper there'?But those posters are paid for. Oh, wait....."
5101,"Yes it's true - many educated, sophisticated and well-off people voted for Ford last time. He fooled a lot of people, and apparently Ken Dryden is one of them. Ford presents himself as the home-spun man standing up for the common man. In fact he is anything but ...As Dryden says, many of Ford's supporters voted for him just to see the know-everythings whine. They think that by electing Ford as Mayor, they're 'sticking' it to the elites. But the reality is that Ford's mantra of tax cuts inevitably leads to cuts in services. We've already seen it. But it's not the jaguar-driving Bay Street Banker that is hurt when TTC routes are cut and fares go up - it's the minimum-wage transit user in Scarborough. When Libraries and Community Centres close their doors, it's not the Rosedale mothers and their children that suffer - it's the single mom living in subsized housing. Yet the single moms, the minimum wage earners, these are the people that constitute Ford's base of support. That's the Big Irony of 'Ford Nation': they think they're sticking it to the elites, but in they end they only hurt themselves. We'll see how many highly educated, politically sophisticated, well-off people vote for Rob Ford again this time around ..."
3161,"The raises to police and fire department are just because of strong unions with arbitrators that have no economic incentive to constrain costs. The wage and benefits has nothing to do with the type of work or what you could reasonably pay a person to provide the service and have to detrimental decrease in quality. These wages have skyrocketed and everybody I know in these fields and I know a lot of them would do the same job for significantly less because there still would not be a salaried job that they could do. It is the golden ticket to become a fireman. Everybody applies for these jobs. There is no danger pay for these jobs. I could see 60,000 for a first class firefighter and you tell me what other career would the candidate pick instead. none."

8313,"Few issues excite like catholic education in Ontario, vestige of the provinces strong history of anti Catholicism, the ' me too'-ism of newer waves of immigrants, and a dollop of lapsed Catholics, the ex-smokers of the religious world. Fact is dismantling the system would be huge and chaotic with real questions as to savings for the taxpayer. No parent would rationally want to take that on while their kids are in either system, and those without kids should not force these risks on to others' kids for the sake of some philosophical point replete with self-righteousness. Political leaders realize this, particularly after the 2007 election. You may not like it, but it's here to stay. Now, flame away..."
10624,The tie-in is something one would expect from Simpson.
1498,I wondering where Justin was when he made these statements. Because the fact is that he was visiting Nelson BC(pot growers central) last week - I'm sure that crowd would have carried him around on their shoulders if it was said there. Maybe just a case of telling every voter what they want to hear.
6071,"Canada has indeed turned on a dime-Think of the Harper years as a time when the parents were in charge and the children were expected to do chores , study and work part time to obtain their spending money..........think of the trudeau jr era as a time when the parents have gone out on an extended vacation-and the teenagers left behind have discovered that the parents have forgotten their AMEX Black Cardits a ton of fun until mom and dad get back home and the charges on the family credit cards need to be accounted for(or maybe they do not)# Greece"
6189,". Then, in this ideal world, a government would say something like, “We have done our best, but not being perfect, we invite other parties and civic society to suggest improvements, since the protection of society against this menace is not a partisan affair. We will listen therefore to all reasonable criticisms and suggestions.” ==================================== Of course, any other political Party in Canada would agree with this statement. Only the current ruling Party doesn't get this concept. Never have, never will. Election 2015.."
3933,"Ms. Wente, your referendum was already held. Remember October 19, 2015?"
198,"Of course it's a bad move and almost everyone in the world feels that way except Liberal partisans. The attacks on Paris are likely the opening shot of what is to be a long war and the war of our times. For the first time in our history Canada will not be participating with boots on the ground and planes in the sky in a major world war and leaving our allies to fend for themselves. We picked up our planes and came home because of some naïve idealogical, new PM. What makes it worse, is that we are deserting one of our mother countries, France, in it's time of need. If we don't help France, who do we help. It's sickening. And Like It Is's comment is wrong. If our jets were contributing little, and I believe that's not true, change the mission so they do more, don't use it as an excuse to run home"
6428,"Good piece. And I agree he is a talented broadcaster. I also think there are other Canadian broadcasters who are more entertaining, more articulate, less fawning, and more probative: Linden McIntyre, Michael Enright, Carol Off, and Sook-Yin Lee included."
1985,"I endorse the Globe, but not the Editorial Board!"
2528,"Interesting perspective. With declining populations in much of the world the only real sources of immigrants will be climate refugees, people from the Middle East (to late this century) and then Africa. Canada will change and it is up to each of us to make sure it changes for the better."
1179,"That is a very strange position of your (Globe and Mail) editorial board and not sure what do you like about the PC party. If this party was that great and ethical, then they should have ousted Mr. Harper long time ago. But they enjoyed the power with him and we all know Harper is a power hungry man and he would do everything to get elected. PC party and Harper are one they are not separate or different from each other. G & M change your position and denounce the PC government (with or without the leader) because they are all bad for Canada."
8183,"The Harper bashing continues unabated. That is alright, he is a big boy and can take it. Trudeau can't find a plank to build a platform, too stoned I guess. Mulcair, sorry every time I think of him I remember 'Government in Waiting, that line still breaks me up and I'm laughing with the tears streaming down, great stand up comedian but a little too angry to be taken seriously. Gonna be a hoot to watch the shucking and jiving leading up to the election. I can hear the chant even now, four more years, four more years,..."
5699,"So let's be balanced here, how mant house hold staff did Harper have and how many does Trudeau have? It is naive of us all to think that a PM of either party representing a G7 country like Canada is not going to need home help."
10593,"Something that is long overdue. However as I read section 43, 1982 amended, it applies only to boundaries and the French and English language. How does it apply to the issue of schools which is clear in section 93 of 1867 act?"
3925,"Both Trudeau and Mulcair are correct on this one. Mulcair is of course the more mature and consistent of the two. What a surprise, eh!"
1402,"After similar shocking, nasty and tasteless attacks on Dion and Ignatieff prior to and during the last two campaigns, and scurrilous attacks on just about anyone in the civil service or funded academia who has spoken out against his policies, why does the writer imagine the public won't stand for this? We eat it up and vote for him, folks. Political disengagement, arguably spawned by bad, short-sighted, partisan decisions and general bad behaviour by politicians, has made an ignorant and malleable electorate. In an online world of anonymous insults, few are surprised and many satisfied by the deniability of those hiding behind a fifth column."
2555,"Listen to CBC's show 'As It Happens' tonight... one of the best take downs of Harper I've had the pleasure to hear. Harper is NOT my prime minister and I will never respect the man, ever! Stephen Harper is, un-Canadian!."
850,"Yes they will pay the lawyers in the class action suits, they will pay the healthy severance for the execs who lose their jobs and they will pay government fines - the VW owners will get next to nothing"
8320,"'They forget our experience in the 1990s, when those most-highly skilled left Canada or couldn’t be persuaded to come to Canada.' High taxes under Mulroney and Chretien ---remember the surtaxes---to get federal deficits and debt under control were a factor, but so was the low Canadian dollar---effectively a 30-40% discount on salaries and organizational budgets---and the latter has returned. So I expect a return to the brain drain quite apart from issues about taxes. Countering taxes and the low dollar in the early 2000s were good public schools, affordable housing, and social peace and tolerance. (I noticed a spike in interest in coming to Canada by highly qualified people after the US invaded Iraq.) The third may still be a factor in Canada's favour in comparison with both the US and Europe, but our municipal and provincial governments and, to a lesser extent, federal governments have done their best to undermine the first two advantages. (Just compare international test results in Canada now compared to ten years ago.)"
8019,"Bang on Peggy! The public school systems are a disgrace and people are seeking whatever improvement they can manage. French immersion is one route. Many parents are also scraping the barrel to send their kids through private systems. Others choose to plug their noses and join the catholic stream. Meanwhile, the unions perpetually hold the public hostage with unsustainable demands and produce a watered down system that panders to the lowest common denominator."
6939,Yes. Just build a wall. Around Donald Trump! This was effectively represented by a French cartoonist who drew an image of happy brick layers Builing a wall around Trump. Problem solved.
4152,"Here is my top 10 list of what drives anti-immigrant sentiment: 1. Hard working Canadians out of work while we are filling their jobs with new Canadians willing to work for much less. 2. High incidence of violence among several immigrant communities. Recent murders in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Toronto have been high profile news stories of late. 3. Thousands of refugees whose applications have been denied are on the lamb in Canada. 4. Hundreds of immigrant Canadians have joined ISIL and are fighting in Syria and Iraq. 5. There are tens of thousands of Canadians of Convenience living all over the world who reap the international benefits of being Canadian but do not contribute to Canada6. There is an international industry targeted specifically at scamming Canadian Immigration. 7. Immigrants have more and better benefits than low income Canadians8. Canadian housing prices are artificially inflated because of immigrants are using their Citizenship to provide money laundering services to their corrupt friends from back home. 9. Practices such as honor killing, female genital mutilation and arranged marriage10. Erosion of Canadian values and traditions facilitated by left wing apologistsI am not against immigration, I am against our policies that allow the above to take place."
1712,Why are the liberal so upset with these ads? Are they embarrassed that they chose a camp counselor/drama teacher/stripper as leader?
4816,My favourite analogy so far. I am repeating it and take no credit for crafting it.The G&M endorses Hell but without Satan.
9039,"'Run by well-known provocateur Ezra Levant, it is completely partisan, entirely hostile to the NDP, and usually unwatchable to anyone but its most fervent followers.'Ezra Lavant is a toxic foul mouthed firebrand who has been part of one failing media outlet after another. He has absolutely zero intention of being 'fair and balanced', he has no intention of reporting, only asking questions of non 'conservative' politicians to provoke them. His conduct is disrespectful and allowing him in the press gallery brings the entire press gallery into disrepute. His show on Sun News Network repeatedly got the network into legal trouble for his defamatory remarks and he never had the class to retract or apologize for his slanderous, infactual remarks, like a respectful journalist would. The man has a long record of unprofessionalism. This entirely disqualifies him of being considered 'media' or a 'journalist'.Yes, some media lean right and some lean left and no government should restrict media simply because they might give unfavorable coverage. Ezra Lavant and every 'media' outlet he has been a part of has pulled one stunt or another to involve themselves in the story, and this is no different. That a reputable organization like the Globe would editorialize in favour of this unprofessional, prolific gong show is beyond the pale. Shame on you, Globe. This guy isn't 'media'. He's simply an instigator. An expose on where this goon gets his funding would have been more appropriate, because it's amazing how this guy leaps from one failed ultra-right wing project to another and never seems to run out of money."
1940,Who wants PM Airhead to begin with?
3156,"I don't really care all that much exactly where in the world Rob Ford is and what he is doing. However, considering how much he has lied in the past about his alcoholism, drug abuse and other serious issues, and also considering the fact that he still intends to run for mayor, we (the public) do have the right to know wether Rob Ford is, indeed, undergoing therapy for his substance abuse problems (both his alcoholism and his drug abuse) and if so, wether the clinic (or rehabilitation spa) he is attending is generally deemed a successful facility with proven substance abuse treatments (the exact name and location of the place is actually not as important as its reputation, wether is can be considered and is generally regarded as successful and scientifically sound).For if Rob Ford is just attending some 'tourism as therapy spa' which caters to the rich and famous but provides little or no scientifically proven therapies for substance abuse, impulse control issues and the like, then that would put Rob Ford's claims (and his family's claims) that he is diligently working on his problems and will be able (and worthy) to run as mayor, to work in politics in absolute and total question."
2637,Harper agrees with separatists on the niqab! (Just to use a straw man argument that defenders of Harper tend to use)
5495,"My background is economics and statistics. I know about energy markets from my work life. I’m mostly self-educated in climate science but with several courses in recent years to fill in some gaps. Climate science is actually a melding of various economics, statistics and energy issues with a large dash of physical sciences underneath so the topic meshes with me well. I don’t think I will bother arguing with “Happy with life” further because it is too much like he is entering a gun fight carrying a knife only. It isn’t fair to Happy and it is an unproductive use of my time to read and respond to his repeated juvenile invectives. Even if I try to reply to his comments, they are likely to end up in moderation like last time so that I can’t reply. Happy is clearly annoyed that his moralist rhetoric doesn’t work on a rational thinker, so I suppose this is why he targets me continuously. Some sort of ideological stance on Happy’s part must be driving his irrational positions but he reveals little of himself beyond his irrational position so I can’t say what that might be. I suspect some deep-seated childhood trauma is at work though, perhaps he didn’t get his fair share of cake at a birthday party and this has led to his special sense of entitlement in a world that wants everyone to play a part in becoming carbon-free.Bye."
8517,"I 'lost hope in justice' when Canada abolished the death penalty. Bourque, Bernardo, Pickton and dozens of others should have been executed years ago. It is an insult to their victims and decent people everywhere that they are kept, fed and clothed in comfort when those they offended against are gone and their families shattered. I have no time for them or the writers of this garbage."

792,Did Bush condemn billions of helpless children with CO2 death threats to an exaggerated climate crisis? Climate blame belief has done to us what Bush's false wars did for the neocons.
7502,"Do you guys even hear yourselves? Seriously. Are you so spectacularly deaf to meaning that you don't see the hypocrisy in your own words? A few weeks ago the Conservatives were whipping up anti-Muslim sentiment during an election and you ENDORSED THEM! Sheesh, it's like being lectured to on morals by Lance Armstrong."

With that family and those friends, who exactly is giving Ford the push he needs to get help? Who is in his corner? His own lawyer said last week that Ford only needed to 'freshen up', for heaven's sake. He's surrounded by enabler and deniers so I don't hold out much hope for him."
10363,"no other Western democracy would undermine their own citizens for the sake of 'openness' and 'multiculturalism'This is unique in CanadaIf yoy travel to Europe, follow the public discourse: France, UK, Denmark, Switzerland... if you want to settle thre, there are very strict criteria to follow. You have to prove that you speak their language, that you share their values (or at least respect their values) Why do we, in Canada, have to be an open gate to the world? Why can't we assert our own democaratic, WESTERN values...? why is it 'xenophobic' to say: we want immigrants into this counry to assimilate?"
10181,"I would like to quote you -'no fan of men on horseback who cause the media to swoon in the face of something new, bright and shiny' I say this because the same can be said of Justin Trudeau and his positions similar to Harper -- low or lower corporate tax; cap&trade and opposition to Keystone not based on science; complimenting Premier Redford's boasting of her environmental record; sale of Nexen OK because it paves the way for free trade with China which will pave the way to middle class prosperity; guns are a part of Canadian culture; poor judgement; and health a management issue not a money issue - to name a few. With respect to Quebec, both Stephen Harper and Justin Trudeau add to the attraction of independence. http://commonsensecanadian.ca/justin-trudeau-just-another-con-man/"

226,"As an often 'overprotective' mother myself, I wholeheartedly agree with Wente's position here. It bothers me that other people can be so judgemental of parents these days. It's particularly irksome to be given unsolicited advice and unwelcome criticism from people who were parents in a more lax era of parenting. One person I know, who was parenting in the 70s and 80s, smoked while pregnant and went frantically searching for her 3-year-old when she lost track of her at a party once in the late 70s. She faced no ramifications or public censure at that time, but there is no end to the criticism she doles out about us parents these days!"

9783,I agree. I also believe that Ms. Yim created a scandal where there was none. It may help make her more famous but I doubt it.
6537,I applaud Trudeau for not embracing tax cuts as central to his political campaign. For many Canadians the few extra dollars in their pockets does not outweigh the loss to programs and services.
290,"The public focus on the smaller expenditures of ministers can be more readily explained by the fact that the public has a better idea of what a ride to the airport costs, but it has no idea about what it costs to build a road or a subway. The public has to trust that the ministers involved have made the right choices on the big ticket items. That trust is eroded when the ministers spend crazy amounts of money on the smaller items that the public can identify with."
5957,"We now see the True-deau. Maybe now the love-in will cool down. Mind you, for some, J2 will be defended tooth and nail for behaviour that would get most people fired."
1976,He's bang on with these comments.
4260,This article makes the exact same mistake that makes people afraid to speak. By referring to Donald trump supporters and saying 'some of whom are white supremecists' it causes people to be afraid to inedtify as a trump supporter because the media lumps them in with white supremacists. Why does the media not refer to ndp supporters and say 'some of whom are communists'? This is why people don't trust mainstream media and the likes of this editorial board and get their info from alt right websites.

140,These helicopter parents will pay for this to some degree. Either their kids will reach their teenage years and go wild making up for lost time. Children as young as 8 or 9 know when they are being held back from exploring and follow their friends and are forced to obey their parents. The other scenario is they may possibly grow up lacking self confidence and have problems socializing with other people. But the worst thing is they may pass it on to their children who will pay an even greater price in later years.
3901,Strange you are so critical of the constituency you write you columns for.
1373,"Like the right wing manifesto that denies climate change, and the God given right to extract the earth's resources for the profit of all, but overwhelmingly for the wealthy, the Leap Manifesto counters with a radically different vision of society and the economy.

I urge all readers to take a look at the piece, Fort McMurray’s Muslim community plans an ambitious, multicultural mosque.' Up there in Fort Mac, the Muslim community celebrated something (ominious?) called World Hijab Day. Oh, and they're planning a lot more than that to celebrate, too. The story is absolutely fascinating..."

The prof says no, but also submits a request for guidance to his dean. Therein lies the problem. He got the request on the books by putting it into writing and sending it off. And how did this ever leak to the media? Who talked in the first place?"
5488,"Funny thing, I was on BP meds of various kinds and my doc told me to quit drinking, smoking etc. So I did. Guess what, still on the meds? You would think if I was supposed to quit and all would be good at least some of these drugs would no longer be required. I am just going to quit the drugs and see what happens. It sounds like a big crock of stuff to me."
8170,"Every Muslim I have ever known has been the kindest, gentlest and generous people you'd ever want to meet. But I don't understand why they remain silent when the worst atrocities perpetrated in the world right now are being done in the name of their religion. Muslims must speak up and let the world know that their religion is not about violence."
558,"The G&M promotes the illusion that we have a free press. What nonsense! What is so free about the media when they are owned by the wealthy who spoon feed us their inhumane values and ways of looking at the world which only seek to legitimize their greed, callous disregard for the well-being of the overwhelming majority of the worlds population and the perpetuates a system of deep social injustice. Remember that 'Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one.' Furthermore it is no secret that Rebel is a fascist propaganda machine. Perhaps I am alone in this, but such fascism should not be allowed to pollute our society."

7626,Stockwell Day appeared on Power and Politics (CBC) last evening and gave the standard Tory justification. 1. Released murderers re-offend every second day. 2. The new law will seldom be required. He could not understand how he had contradicted himself within 30 seconds.
6278,"'Ultimately, however, it is a matter of fairness.'Not sure that is the key issue here. Is it 'fair' that people without children pay education taxes? Is it 'fair' that some people experience random crimes and others do not? Is it 'fair' that tall people have to sustain many more head injuries due to standard door sizes? Is it 'fair' that left-handed people have to be inconvenienced almost everywhere in order to live in our right-handed world, and live several years less on average as a result? Is it 'fair' that small and thin people pay the same for clothing as regular-sized people, and considerably more per unit of cloth than obese people? For that matter, is it fair that medical doctors are paid relatively more in North America, by far, than in any other place in the world? Life is not fair. Airlines are running a business in a world increasingly constrained by energy and fuel costs. They are no different than door manufacturers who are not about to start building doors 6 inches higher at the same price for tall people. It costs more to accommodate people of different shapes and sizes throughout our society. This is just one more example. Please stop playing the shame card."
2797,"uck ou, lobe"
2449,How is anyof this a surprise? The effects of Harper's policies have been pointed out all down the line. Lets not blame the decade when the true cause is walking right in front of us in Ottawa. The Harper quest to turn Canada into a low wage destination for Corporations is destroying Canadian society and pushing large numbers of the former middle class into poverty. The result will be economic disaster and an unstable society where many have nothing left to lose.
6458,"Considering the author would rather write about Trump then extol the virtues or lack of virtues of Hillary makes one believe she is a victim of Trump's media control. Meanwhile despite her efforts Hillary continues to slide in the polls, something, if the author could take a break from the Trump train, she might consider worthy of commentary."

795,"The Fair Elections Act does not pass the sniff test. In fact, it stinks."
9321,I have a lot of respects for Canadian doctors and the process of picking them. Consider it costs over US$100 to see a doctor in the U.S. while OHIP pays a doctor around C$35. Our doctors here are as good as their counterparts in the U.S. but they have to work much harder to have the same standard of living. We should not judge doctor by a perfect standard. They are just a human being a little better in characters in general.
11399,"The claim that we can readily convert to a 100% renewable energy system is false and irresponsible. The only form of renewable energy capable of providing dependable capacity on the scale required to displace all carbon sources is hydro. To displace the existing coal and gas resources and meet load growth from electrification of transportation would require about 60,000 MW of new large-scale dependable capacity, almost all of which would be hydro, even if we initiate geothermal projects. The Site C hydro project in BC that the David Suzuki foundation is opposing would be just the tip of the iceberg. The carbon fundamentalists, by proposing a 100% renewable electricity system, are basically declaring war on Canada's rivers and, ironically, the First Nations who depend on those waters."
1539,The Conservative sheep are as bad as their leader. Wilful ignorance and blind faith have no place in politics. If ever there was a party that needed to be destroyed and rebuilt from the ground up it's this party.
4010,I don't think there is anything more condescending than a Tory Elitist like Margaret claiming to know the mind of the 'masses'. The only people who use that word are either Marxist bone heads or populist half wits. Oh and Tory partisans like Maggie who like to cast a little bit of a cover over their Conservative rants.
9505,"I have seen where there is big money to be won in video gaming competitions. It is like professional poker playing. Not to mention in the development industry. If they are gaming and are talented and want to compete, or have ideas for new games, maybe it isn't all bad."

The world has to live with terrorism as it has for a very long time - England in the 1960's 1962 FLQ in Canada.

1318,"Personally I think they do a very risky job as do police officers. When you compare a firefighters work to a school teacher and consider that teachers work 3/4 of a year to earn their salary, I think a firefighters pay is on par with these others. They may not be 'busy' every minute they are working, but who is?? No question they put there lives at risk, they are exposed to dangerous cancer causing fumes etc etc and for this they should be compensated. I believe hospitals nurses esp in ER/ ICU acute medical and surgical wards are also underpaid. So there!!"
1393,"This joke of an editorial just about guarantees an NDP win. Some Toronto based hack lecturing Alberta on political choices-- as if we are too dumb to understand the reality we face. The PC are systemically corrupt- they cannot cure themselves. Rotten right through to the core, they can no longer make a distinction between a tax dollar and a dollar they put in their own pockets. The civil service in Alberta is also corrupted to the point where numerous municipalities thought it was ok to donate tax dollars to the PC party general fund. They actually didn't think it was wrong. The PC's have no answers. Notley will at least look for solutions. The Globe is absurd-- a shill for the Reform party everywhere. WE ARE FED UP WITH the band of thieves in power. We need something new and the NDP aren't going to scare away any companies. Lord, Rona the Harper handpuppet Ambrose even jumped into the fray today. The big red scare-- sounded like we all woke up in Oklahoma. The globe editorial is bought and paid for-- joke"
26,"The Liberals have really hurt their chances by coronating the debutante from Montreal. They are all giddy with the enthusiasm that a young fresh face brings but Canadians will have nearly two years to figure out that he is an empty vessel that should have stuck to snowboarding or thespianism. I can't wait for the Conservative ads that ask the pointed question 'Why is Trudeau charging Canadian schools and charities $270,000 for speeches while he is a highly paid millionaire MP?'. There is no credible answer to that."
5999,finally someone pointing out the obvious the police budgets are out of control and the politicians so far have done nothing about ittime for them to start with a very big hatchet
184,"Prior to 1995 (the year Mike Harris was elected), I almost always voted PC, sometimes Liberal. But since '95, I have never, ever voted Conservative. I liked the idea of a socially progressive party, that would keep a close on our country's finances. This is why we need a new kind of voting system to replace first past the post."
3012,"The incompetence and silence and absence of Harper yesterday, his shaky appearance when he finally emerged at 8:00 p.m., has forever debunked the myth of a competent Harper. Read Michael tenDant's column in the National Post today for a good list of everything wrong with how this was handled. We've had a glimpse ofhow Harper acts in a crisis now and one can only shudder to think of how he would handle an even larger crisis. His tone deafness, lack of empathy and insight into what people needed, were on full display,, but as anyone who has observed his profound narcissism undersyands, not surprising."

7183,"You under-measure the skill of his (undoubtedly and deservedly expensive) lawyer. A less financed accused than Ghomeshi, with a less competent lawyer, able to spend less time on the case, would not have been able to produce all the evidence against the complainants. It was they who condemned themselves, but tracking down and using that evidence was a great deal of legal time spent. One can be sure that without such service the complaints would have stood and the accused would have been found guilty. Who ever thought justice was equally available to all?"
1437,"It is an asinine proposition to try and relate vaccinations, pollution, the burning of fossil fuels as all anti-science and related to the progressive movement. Margaret — even for you — have outdone yourself with this kind of malarkey."
5119,"The Harper government / CRA has systematically reviewed and revoked charitable status of organizations that cater to fluffy stuff like the environment, human rights, women, the marginalized, the arts... As they maintain a dogma that healthcare is a provincial jurisdiction. So the family foundation asked, likely others do regularly, why announce this one, not others? And I'm peeved by the recently announced 'matching' donations to Syrian aid. They won't do anything unless we pony up, but it looks like they are 'doing' something."
104,"The gravy train would be over if Trumps gets in and that's what the establishment is scared of. But lets ask a serious question. Is the US Superpower on the way up or in a downfall?

So, should they stick with the same (pork barrelling, special interests, back room deals etc.) or try something completely different. If I were American I would vote for real change. On their current path it's all downhill from here and we will follow."

10491,"We get it. For Harper policy is just campaign strategy. It's not about what's right or what's best. It's about what will help him win an election, but we don't have to accept that. Journalists need to do a better job and refusing to do his work. Stop honing Harper's wedges. Stop analyzing policy for its campaign effects and instead analyse it's actual content and real consequences."
1302,"I believe the vast majority of Canadians would accept that one's religion is a private matter and a personal choice. The same holds true for agnostics and atheists. No one should care about someone else's beliefs or lack of same. The act of receiving citizenship in a country, at least ours, should also be neutral. I don't expect an atheist to have to swear allegiance on a bible, nor a catholic use a King James version of the same book. The religious garb of certain Muslim cultures introduces religion into what is a civil and public ceremony. Wearing a niqab in downtown Toronto or Vancouver is fine, if one wishes to show one's religion, but do not introduce this intent into a 'neutral' occasion. The same goes for extreme Christians or any other religious following. Becoming a Canadian is not about race, colour, or belief. It is about adopting a new home."

10299,"Ibbitson in repeating Trudeau's words out of context and with a dishonest twist is just playing along with the PMO. Trudeau did not dismiss the Canadian mission by saying Harper was “trying to whip out our CF-18s and show them how big they are.” In fact he had given a very cogent discussion of the role Canada could and should play and-like most of the partners in this enterprise-why taking part in the bombing was not necessarily the best route. The quip about Harper was dead on however, the man loves bombast, loves dressing up and marching around though he vanishes when danger appears.. Grabbing a partial statement and repeating it out of context and changing its meaning is what the PMO does and what Iibbitson, their faithful hack, is happy to echo.. Last night 22 Minutes did an excellent parody of the Conservatives attack ads with their Turd eau skit. I guess that whistled over Ibbitsons head. The US did not request Canadian combat involvement in this fresh new quagmire, Harper requested it. He was evasive and dishonest about Canadian involvement which is one reason the other parties could not go along with his plans for combat and he has still not revealed the cost of the operation. But Ibbitson is such a fan of Harpers incremental approach and evidently the lack of transparency that goes along with it that he will apparently whole heartedly approve when Canadians awake to find they have sleepwalked into an unending quagmire. And just to put the icing on the cake. while fighting ISIS on the ground in Iraq and Syria. Harper has made a massive arms sale to Saudi Arabia, the homeland and prime funders of the Wahhabi and jihadi extremism that is sweeping the world. Oh and naturally the terms of that arms deal is also top secret."

Our problem in all sectors especially for the middle class is the govt intervention is crowding out business with regulations not the opposite. Your posts border on stupidity. ____________________________@Cabo - As I said in the comment I made, we need to open up competition so that we can have more companies in this country. Corporations are not supposed to be a huge part of free market capitalism. Corporatism is where large companies dominate everything and we rely on them. Free markets depend on small businesses and medium sized businesses being the main driver of such economies. We of course have not had a free market economy in the entire history of our country. We have always been a mixed economy and it has served us well. Ontario and Quebec have always had manufacturing sectors and BC with their forestry sector. If you want a so-called free market economy which I believe it isn't since too big to fail became popular starting in 2007-08 then the USA may be your place to go. The truth is the USA had to bail out industries, and that doesn't bother you? Free markets are not real since capitalism had to 'be saved' in 2008. Of course saving implies that the taxpayers are the heroes and deserve payback. Maybe taxpayers should get some money back. The truth is corporatism is what we have!"
6288,"I really wish the media would stop concentrating on the negative. There's been little mention either in the globe or on TV about the fact that Kathleen Wynne & Rachel Notley met a few days ago. Wynne is supportive of the east- West pipeline. Saskatchewan & Manitoba will support it, as will all the Atlantic provinces. I believe Couillard will eventually sign on too & Coderre & his mayors can't stop it.Sometimes I wonder if an east-west battle doesn't suit the media better than an optimistic attitude."

5298,"Well said, Ms. Collenette. Where's the moral compass, indeed? These people should be held to and observe the highest of moral standards and it would appear that they are not and do not. I worked for a very large company for many years and held myself and was held to a very high standard. Not only could I not consider doing anything unethical (bribery, conflict of interest, etc.) but could not do anything that someone else might even think was a little shady. I worked hard for what I earned and never dreamed of trying to supplement my income by cheating on my expense statements. I don't think that makes me a hero. I think this kind of behaviour is just, well 'normal' or, at least, should be. We need very tough rules but we also need very honest people representing our interests and, in this case, it seems we have neither. I'm not surprised, just disappointed."

7143,"It seems to me that the problem for Mr. Eich was not his view on same sex marriage, but rather that he was head of a firm, Mozilla, and as such his comments and views had a detrimental impact on that company's image. When somebody is the head of any organization, their public behaviour and statements need to reflect positively on that organization and be compatible with the values of its owners, employees and customers. Nobody is disputing his right to oppose gay marriage- the problem is that Mozilla's reputation was being damaged by his view that gays should not enjoy the same rights as others. If the President of GM or Ford came out with personal views which were offensive or insulting on any topic, I suspect there would be investor and customer backlash and the person would have to be replaced. This is not about free speech or political correctness, but it is about his obligation to behave appropriately as the head of this company."

326,"As an Aussie I think I'm well placed to address/rebut 3 points: 1. It was promised as price neutralIt was never promised to be revenue neutral - the whole idea of carbon pricing is to increase the cost of environmentally damaging products eg. coal fired power so that people will think twice about using them and think seriously about switching to less damaging products. That's why it was always a POLITICAL problem - because it promised to push up prices. 2. Price increasesPrices did increase, but not nearly by as much as the conservatives predicted (read: scare mongered). Now that it's gone prices MAY go back down but in reality there are many other factors driving up the cost of electricity, such as network maintenance, etc. 3. Comparing price increasesI believe the price increase was less than $10 per week per household but not all of this was attributable solely to the carbon tax. This may sound like a lot but any comparison of price increases with electricity prices in Canada will be flawed because you guys really pay nothing for electricity in Canada. My power bills in Melbourne WITHOUT air conditioning (where temperatures range from lows of 0 to highs of 40) is about $1000 per year for a 2 person household. I think you'll find that compares VERY favorably to here."

Well, Mr Bellan refused to play ball, and instead wrote about the process of the attempt to co-opt him. Kudos to Mr Bellan for his intelligent exposé of the Harper message control machine."

9354,"'Income-splitting is supposed to help “hard-working taxpayers,”Wrong! This tax measure was never designed to benefit anyone, rather it was designed to balance an inequitable tax equation. The argument is that income splitting will only benefit wealthy families. How is a dual income family with two income earners each making $50,000 any different than a single income family with an income of $100,000? Hopefully you said the $100,000 single income family has less take-home pay. While both families (and let's say they both have 4 kids to keep things even) earn $100,000 per year, the fact is that the $100,000 single income is taxed at a higher marginal rate than $50,000. Stripping all credits out other than the basic amount to which everyone is entitled, the tax paid by the dual income family will be roughly $16,000 whilst the tax paid by the single income family will be closer to $24,000 (that factors in the basic credit for the spouse). Even if the maximum credit for the income splitting was achieved for the single income family, they would still be on the hook for $22,000 in tax. All income splitting was ever designed to do is try an balance the equation... and rightly so too."

Gaming provides the escape for me that nothing else can. I love that I can be lost in another world, creating mayhem and destruction, and then leave it behind.

As for her 'stats' I mean, really Maggie. 18% of SOCIAL SCIENCES professors identify themselves as Marxist, And 6% identify as Conservative? And Wente presents the stats as if this represents a radical shift from when the SOCIAL SCIENCES was dominated by Conservative thinking.... (as in NEVER). The 6% 'Conservative' is probably a rising trend. This particular incident seems extreme and ridiculous - but the trend at universities, certainly from a student body perspective is that they are moving more from the left - to at least the center and possibly more to the right. Why is this? Because the cost of a University education has risen, housing costs at an Urban university like Ryerson have risen, and only the middle class and above can afford to go.I think her entire premise is wrong and her borrowed hypothesis not applicable to these isolated 3 cases."
6672,"Sarah Kendzior's articles are very reminiscent of Marcus Gee and Rob Ford. EVERY day another article is written on why she doesn't like Trump (or Gee didn't like Ford).

5022,"This is why Stephen Harper is NOT a leader in any way, shape or form. He has to go. A comparison to Australia is most damning. Tony Abbott is on the ropes, is routinely excoriated for inaction on climate, and even a brief visit to Auz. land would be enough to convince anyone of the need for action on climate. The effects of climate change are very apparent in Australia and they are coming, if not as fast (except perhaps in the far north) to Canada make no mistake. The suggestion that Harper might appreciate climate change, but won't do anything about it for political reasons is the saddest comment of all. MANY people WILL make sacrifices, but we DO require LEADERSHIP in this!"

I am a Polish immigrant, not a single Polish or any other Slavic minister in this cabinet. Does it mean I'm not represented? I'm not represented by this government because I didn't vote Liberal, not because I don't see any fellow Poles there. In fact I, a Polish born white male would be more represented by a whole cabinet of none white women who share my views and ideas than a whole cabinet made up of Polish men. To think that somehow this 'diversity' does any good is wrong. Btw Sikhs have been getting all the privileges and advantages lately. Tinny ethnic group (only 24 to 27 million Sikhs in the world) somehow manages to bring in 11,000 to 15,000 immigrants a year for the last 25 years. How is that fair?"

This is a devious way to assign guilt by insinuation and generate soundbite style public information to Canadians. This conflict is a Ukrainian conflict and a European affair, not a Canadian or Nato business. Europeans do not welcome neocon-style war mongering statements such as this. Harper does not even get his facts right. The Crimea population separated from Ukraine following a referendum, which is a legal way to separate. (as may be the case one day for Scotland or Quebec). Providing military training to one side and vilifying the other is not serving the cause of peace, anywhere in the World, that is true in Ukraine. The Prime Minister is once again embarrassing us Canadians; let us hope that it will not be for long."

7256,"Yep, that was quite a rain storm. The difference between the folks living today, (Boomers et el) and the Canadians who lived in the first half of the 20th century, was not the durability of their infrastructure. The difference was in their resilience in the face of difficulty. They had to deal with the Great Depression, followed in short order by the Great War. (In which about 1 in every 125 Canadians were either killed or wounded) Somehow, they would have coped with a rain storm, without thinking it was the End of the World."
541,"Canadians expect their leaders to be moderates but Harper has proven to be an extremist, right wing, conservative with an evangelical's zeal for turning Canada into an international pariah.

At this rate we can expect to be kicked by our 'master' for tripping on his heels."

206,"You raise an interesting issue, Margaret, although you don't deal with it adequately. I guess you're saying, in effect, that we don't want a person as seemingly erratic as Trump as president with his fingers on the buttons and all. First off, surely there are now safeguards to overturn decisions of presidents when it comes to nuclear war. At least, I hope there are. Second, Trump at least is opposed to aggressive wars and won't bomb Iran as other Republican candidates have threatened. That's a greater threat to peace than anything Trump has suggested."
741,Wedge issue? Even the rest of this editorial doesn't support that. Another incoherent ramble from the editorial board. What is going on at the Globe?
7193,"Couldn't agree more and I am a former CBC news employee and someone who believes in true 'public' broadcasting - which sadly the CBC does not engage in. Keep in mind that as the CBC continues to infringe upon the advertising life blood territory of private broadcasters, those same private entities are being virtually forced by the CRTC to invest millions in local news and thus forced to compete with CBC's subsidized and extremely well-resourced product. Local news is critically important and private broadcasters should be investing in it. However, how can they justify doing so to their shareholders when a subsidized competitor with great expertise and acumen in journalism also wants to take away their main source of revenue? It is patently wrong and skews the market in extremely negative ways. Having CBC convert to a PBS model of subsidy + donations is also not a solution because presently, there are hundreds of small, independent media (like Alberta's CKUA Radio Network) that are almost entirely reliant on donations revenues to survive. Allowing CBC to receive donations AND subsidy will merely have them competing with the independent media, likely resulting in their demise, something that is also not a good solution. The simple solution is to have a CBC that engages in true 'public' broadcasting. To my mind that would be expertly produced news & current affairs, children's, dramatic and variety programming that reflects Canada. CBC should eliminate Radio2 altogether given it's 'popular music' tendencies - something more than accounted for private and independent broadcasters throughout Canada. Have CBC get out of the sports game (sorry) or privatize its world class production expertise and sell that to the private broadcasters who want to provide sports coverage, as a revenue supplement and have the government of Canada appropriately fund CBC to do the things it 'should' be doing. in summary; refocus on news& current affairs, children's TV, as well as dramatic and variety television, shut Radio2, privatize and contract out its sports production expertise and eliminate all advertising across platforms. Then have the federal government fund what would be a true 'public' broadcast entity."

They are taught safety above all, negotiation, co-operation, always be nice, no playing with guns, listening, non-violence, team play is better than acting individually, etc, so that's what you get now. The young men of today are a far different breed from the young men around when I was young, i.e. a bunch of soldiers just back from World War II. They would have reacted, and did react, in a way this young lady would like. Sorry, can't have it both ways."

I see no reason why someone should not be able retain their ability to vote while living overseas - as long as they continue to pay Canadian taxes on their entire income. Ah, the voters' line has diminished in length. If you're not contributing to the country (e.g. residency, taxes) your influence to shape policy should be diminished. The greatest of sacred Canadian cows is provincial medical coverage; guess what, you lose that too after spending the majority of a year outside of the country. Take heart, this is not a loss of citizenship. Move back, pay the taxes so politicians can hand back a fraction of them for your vote."

The only reason that Putin decidedly to join France and US now is because he realized that he just opened up the hornet nest. He did not want the Russians to be the only ISIS main target. He wanted to shift the ISIS focus away from Russians to NATO and US. Only Conservative can fall for Putin's tricks. lolMajority of Canadians just voted to end the CF18 combat mission in the Middle East by electing Trudeau. Did you forget that? Military experts has been emphasizing that the war against ISIS can not be won by air bombing alone. It needs more ground force actions. What better contribution than providing more training for the Kurdish to fight ISIS on the ground. Even France and the US acknowledged that is the important contribution that Canada can make to this fight. Mr. Trudeau can focus our resources on helping the refugees resettlement. Remember the people who are being chased and killed by Assad, and ISIS? Nice try with the Conservative talking points!"

5617,"The Speaker could have just stood up to stop Mr Calandra... but further, did anyone else find it telling, as did I, that the MP's 'apology' was offered at the tail end of QP on FRIDAY... after most members had toddled off for their weekend? Who actually saw/heard it?? Sheesh!"
9501,"Who do you think you are, Globe and Mail? Each and every speaking event was cleared with the Ethics Commissioner. He paid for all associated travel himself. Where is the conflict? What rules were broken? What laws were broken? None!!"
5972,Liberal ideology meets the real world.
11181,"While no one deserves to be treated poorly, I still find these conversations where 'sex working' is treated along the same lines as, say, office administration, a little odd. Sexual intimacy is a complex human interaction, which of course ultimately leads to reproduction and the continuation of the species. Prostitution involves selling this for money to a stranger. Few women (or men for that matter) will do this unless they feel, for some reason, that they absolutely have to, that there's no other way to earn a living. It's not a career choice parents would want for their children either. The profession has been around since the beginning of human history, and I agree that people who out of some misfortune end up doing this to make a living should not be exploited or harmed. But I don't agree that it should be considered on par with other forms of employment available to people in our society."
10194,"Just one point. The Conservatives have not reduced personal income-tax rates since arriving in office. They are exactly where they were when the Liberals left office. The personal exemption has increased, but so it did under the Liberals. What the Conservatives have done is link tax-breaks to spending. Spend money and you will get a tax-break. The tax-code has been littered with boutique tax-credits that have not been subjected to any cost-benefit analysis insofar as the general taxpayer is concerned. So, not only to do we have added governmental debt, but we also have increased household debt. What growth we've enjoyed has been on borrowed money."
9045,Notice the difference between Canada and the US. Trump is campaigning on bringing industry back to the US - raising the wages of the average American - putting the US first. While in Canada the Ontario Liberals have just announced their 'green' scam which will drive industry out of the province and cost citizens billions. The US under Trump will thrive - while Ontario will whither and die.
9590,"The pendulum swings. The words of Edward Kennedy can be used by any politician after a defeat, of any stripe, by pro-life, pro-choice, pro-gun, anti-free trade, anti-war, pro-war, it doesn't matter. To never die, a dream does not have to be good."
2307,"Went is right about one detail: as long as fossil fuel is the cheapest option, we'll use it. So that's what we have to change. It's really the same thing as people eating junk burgers instead of healthy food: as long as it's cheaper, we'll do it. It takes another level of thinking to realize that it's only short-term cheaper. Those burgers are going to put you in the expensive hospital 20 years early."
11479,"three things come imediately to mind. 1. Why are the liberals paying off the teachers unions? 2. Is the timing suspect only to me, how better to keep this out of the press when the Premier is off supporting Trudeau? 3. How brazen is this act, especially in this economic climate when young people can't find work (including young teachers because the old retired teachers come back and take all the supply jobs - why they are paid to do this is beyond me). Teachers should be careful... People are growing tired of their rightous grandstanding while holding our kids edcuaton hostage."
8961,"It would have been nice to actually have some objective numbers to back up his thesis , rather than a couple of third hand stories ."
8721,"Upper incomes are rising, lower incomes are stagnating or falling. It's that simple, stupid."
11904,"Jeffrey, Jeffrey--such hyperbole in your last sentence. It undermines everything preceding it."
10218,"The writer is trying to tell us that Islam is modern too. But she says she once believed music, except for the drum, was inappropriate. Well, non-Muslims haven't felt that way about music for hundreds if not thousands of years, so I'm not convinced Islam is that far from medieval times, or worse."
11488,"1. A large part of Canada's success since 2008 is due to the banking legislation put in to effect by the previous Liberal government (which Harper had opposed), and the surplus that was left to Harper when he took office, and then promptly squandered. Furhter, it was the Liberals and other opposition parties that forced the minority government o bring in a renewed budget in early 2009 that was based on investment (remember the prorogation crisis) 2. It is partly begin tiered of Mr. Harper for many reasons, but Trudeau comes with the Liberal party - a very trusted brand - look no further than the growing number of provincial Liberal governments."
1646,"What has Wente been smoking? her argument is flawed from the start, being illigal makes it easier to obtain, a joint is way easier for kids to get than a bottle of beer so what is she talking about?"
5551,"This is what happens when stupid people go to war on the drop of a CEO's whisper or Dick Cheney's nod. There are consequences taking 'bad regimes' down. Would be good if Went acknowledged circumstances but of course not. Tat would require thinking, not reacting."
1194,"If Trudeau is stymied by the Senate, then his experience and response may well be similar to Obama's. Obama has had to deal with a Congress that is bound and determined to undermine most of his policy ideas. It remains to be seen whether our own currently Conservative senate behaves similarly, at least until Trudeau appoints 22 new senators."
8196,"A large number of Canadians want to reduce the tsunami of immigrants, refugees, migrants, temporary foreign workers, absentee landlords and foreign buyers of homes; stop the sell off of hundreds of Canadian companies to foreign multinationals, stop sending Canadian jobs overseas, reverse the loss of Canadian values, and reverse somewhat the consequences of 35 years of multiculturalism. The G & M, contrarily, has as it's uppermost priority the growing of the global economy and the profits of the multinational billionaires who run Canada, the people of Canada be darned. Why they hate Trump so much is, like the NDP in Canada, Trump threatens to actually change the economy for tens of millions of frustrated workers."
4637,"Assad is using Russian weapons to defend his own people Shia Muslims, Christians, Alawi Muslims from Sunnis coming from other countries, including Canada, armed by US and financed by Saudi Arabia. I think Wente know that."
11556,"The world is changing rapidly... the West is in decline and Asia, in particular China , is in the ascendancy ...it is competitive and will be more so...unless our young can compete with their peers in Shanghai , Mumbai, Seoul, Tokyo, Singapore they will find themselves living at a third world level."
3892,Cue the G&M editorial supporting Harper
5880,Beyond doubt?
11057,"The downside of democracy -- when enough of the voting public is angry, reckless, ill-informed and/or stupid, it will nominate and even elect a brash demagogue like Donald Trump. This is not the first time, though given the stakes in a nuclear world, it might be the last. There has never been a candidate less qualified for the presidency than Trump. Investigative reports by major news organization (Washington Post, The Economist, etc.) have exposed his personal myth-making as factually in error. But his infatuated fans, here and elsewhere, are unconcerned with facts -- as with other issues (e.g, the science of climate change), when they don't like the facts they simply ignore them and invent their own. Some of the Trump backers are simply enjoying the show, hoping like juveniles for more car crashes and explosions, but most bring to mind the cult of a David Koresh or a Jim Jones, so fanatical is their zeal. In the end, they are bound to make The Establishment they seek to humiliate look good by comparison, or at least stable and sane."
1717,This sure is a tumultuous honeymoon. They live like the top 1% and they throw tax payers money away like the top 0.01%
11018,Trudeau laid down his benchmark a few years ago when he yelled across the floor that a Conservative member was a 'lying piece of $&!?' . His immaturity and lack of verbal debating skills are as obvious now as they were then. Even his apology was a string of 'uhs' and 'ums'. Sadly Canadians fell for the marketing spin and pretty boy packaging that was put around him and we are stuck with him for another three and a half years.
10533,"The judge's rebuke of Harper and the PMO was devastating. How did Wente not mention one of the most significant parts of the judge's verdict? Nice try, but the PMO was called out for being the deceitful, schemers that most of us already knew they were. Let's try telling the whole story Ms. Wente."
1466,So you claim the average Canadian is in support of this antidemocratic twaddle? That is why 2/3 of Candians identified in polls indicate that the 'fair election act' (sic) is really just a cynical ploy by the conservatives to settle old scores.
4809,You think that the big government of Stephen Harper is more right-wing than the Republicans? You really should know better.
2529,"Yes, the political discourse has resulted in the US failing to manage the access and availability to firearms. However, it is further hampered by the lack of alignment within the US (particularly between the different regions (South, Mid-West vs Pacific Coast, Northeast) about what an appropriate solution should be. Witness the current stand-off in Oregon"
10032,"Harper's corporate masters will give him some spin baffle-gab to pass onto his supporters that will justify doing nothing on the environment issue that would hamper tar sands expansion. Canda could be leading the world in developing the new generation of safe nuclear, compact cold fusion, thorium reactors, but instead our government is investing everything in a dinosaur tech that will inevitably be supplanted by a new paradigm."
5225,"The published unemployment rate is 7%. The real rate of unemployed / under-employed and discouraged workers is probably 15%. There is no labour shortage (with a few exceptions) in Canada. The levels of immigration and temporary foreign workers allowed into this country are not justified by the rate of real unemployment. The Royal bank reported profits of 11% today, yet during the summer was found to have laid-off Canadians and replaced them with temporary foreign workers. End immigration and temporary foreign workers and you'll find that most of those Canadians that can't get a decent job, even when they have the skill set needed, will start getting hired."
242,"A platoon of Special Forces doesn't constitute anywhere near the 2+ divisions needed to defeat ISIL. Then you have to hold what you captured. Six F-18s are just a drop in the bucket. If they were flying in support of an active military campaign, that would be different. Truth be told, it has to be Muslim/Arab troops but I don't see any country, even Iraqi Shias willing to take them on. Kurds will go a certain distance - perhaps even Mosul because they want the oil. There is no appetite even by the war hungry US Republicans for more body bags. I fear ISIL will not be defeated militarily."
6578,"Well I'm not having a 'terrific little time', nor am I gleeful. I think the bullies have won and this upsets me, so I ask: What will the bullies demand next? What will it take to make the Globe and Mail stand up to them?"
2743,Baby Trudeau wants to be like Daddy Trudeau and people are fed up with it. He keeps up his nonsense he will be a one term wonder.
9879,Wente - out of touch as usual - 'soak the rich' - yeah because they have had so bad for years now
2282,"Gender equality and other human rights should always override any religious and cultural values/practices and we should demand this commitment from all newcomers as well as from Canadian citizens. Furthermore, in addition to the society's needs, the cost benefit analysis for a decision on the annual targets should also include an environmental impact assessment."
1170,"Beyond cultural and religious dimensions, beyond individual freedoms and social norms, lies the fact that, in some countries women are being flogged and otherwise penalized for not wearing head covering. Just that fact alone behooves us to stand with the women - give them the tool, the excuse, to come out of this medieval attire. Globe, as usual, sides with Neanderthals..."
8585,Wake up JS. Enough doubting of JT. He is thinking this through with the help of others who have learned from past chest thumping that has failed. Try offering some suggested solutions to helping him through this. Bombing always kills the wrong people.
2516,I can just see Harper and Lynton Crosby smirking and snickering now. Inciting racism worked for Crosby in the Australian and British elections and some Canadians are falling for it too. The niqab was a total non-issue until very recently. Don't let this issue be the deciding factor in which way you vote. Read 'Party of One' and google Stephen Harper/Northern Foundation. Get informed.
619,"MacKenna 2 hours ago 'In other news, the Auditor General releases a damning report on the Harper government's horrific incompetence, waste, and neglect of duty to ensure our safety.'Wow Liberal deflection attempt #3 look a squirrel!!!!"
1912,ABL- Anyone but the Liberals
5059,"The Globe and Mail Editorial Baord, in calling for Trudeau to explain his intended action to stop bombing the IS, is the correct thing for a responsible newspaper to report. We've had enough of Main Stream Media indoctrination since 1968. Maybe, to the G&M, this is a turning point. Rightly so."
10012,"One comment is about 'Barbaric backward animals'-'barbaric backward animals' YES oh Yes. The U.S. killed 500, 000 civilians in Iraq; weddings parties blown to bits in Afghanistan; 2000 killed every three years in Israel as they steal land & helped create a GHETTO of GAZA; armed the 'Rebels' in Syria who became Al Qaeda/Isis; sell asbestos to 3rd world countries; sell 15 billion worth of Armoured Vehicles to Saudi Arabia who are SUNNI as are ISIS & Al Qaeda.. If you sleep with them guess what ??? 'BARBARIC BACKWARD ANIMALS-- YES RIGHT ON MAN. GIVE ME MR. TRUDEAUS APPROACH ANYTIME & we will then slowly but surely have SECURITY WITHOUT FEAR. I DO NOT CONDONE OR SUPPORT EITHER SIDE IN THEIR MURDEROUS WAYS."
11789,People no longer believe in our national newspapers after their multiple endorsements of the most odious government in the history of Canada.
8017,"Get lost, Yakabuski! The public service contains people of all political stripes. Such a ridiculous waste of column space on specious sarcasm.'In the tiny company town that is Ottawa' - Since Harris amalgamated us, the City of Ottawa is now pushing a million people. Agreed that this isn't Toronto or Montreal but it's not Kapuskasing either."
2912,Let me be clear- G&M has created another level of low for themselves.
7200,"As a young man from Ontario, I learned fluent French while making my living in Montreal for several years. I had first had French classes in Grade 7 in an Ontario school. My child went through French Immersion to Grade 8 in Toronto. In high school she went to Normandy on a three month family exchange where her hosts spoke almost no English. Those three months did wonders for her accent and fluency. I am sure that French Immersion is not the only effective way to learn French as a second language. There are other effective methods. I am convinced that second language learning methods have improved hugely in recent decades."
8673,The fact that Islamic churches have to put out public-service documentation advising their members not to become terrorists should tell you something about the religion itself.
131,"Unfortunately the emotional immaturity displayed by Kenny, Harper, and their operatives is not an oddity, but a common psychological condition common to conservatives. They are like the kid in elementary school who believes that tattling on his classmates will endear him to the teacher. Like the kid who cheats at games played only for fun because he can't stand to lose, even though by doing it he is branded as a cheat and a loser. So it is with the Harper crowd, and thst is precisely why they must be kept from power ever again."
11145,"'100% of Scientist' - right.... and scientists also get things wrong all the time. How many claims of cold fusion have there been? where is the acid rain of the 80's, we were running out of oil in the 70's? Scientists also get it right, but who get's it wrong the most are journalists. '100% of scientists'? right, nice claim. here is some facts for you. 1 - most of the technology that is changing the environment for us was created by Scientists2 - 1 giant volcano can eject more pollution into the atmosphere in one day, than all the cars on the planet can eject in a year. 3 - Over population is the biggest danger to our environment for all life on our planet. 4 - If we never had science in the first place, we wouldn't be having this conversation. Don't get me wrong, I sooooo love science. What I hate is the media who doesn't get the big picture and just runs with a panic story."
4701,"If this article is correct, which I believe it to be there is no way Trump will ever be president. There are not enough uneducated, bigoted, angry, old white men in the US to elect a president."
6923,No need for bitterness. Let 'sunny ways' be your guide; it will sooth your soul. The universe is unfolding as it should.
3157,"The article ends with the most important point--every change in legislation that specifically addresses terrorism, and particularly those that remove civil liberties, is a success for terrorists. Moreover, it will do nothing but encourage more because it gets the media attention and security response that is vastly disproportional to the actual threat."
5987,The rules of the senate preclude this gift.
8296,"Just go in to it with your eyes wide open. Know that going in to most BA university programs is NOT preparation or qualification for a specific career/job. If you (and your parents) are willing to throw $60,000 and 4 years of your life to this endeavour, at least know what the REALISTIC job prospects are."
7073,Good to see a Pierre Trudeau lackey like Lawrence Martin is so interested in Kevin O'Leary. I could make the same comparison between Trudeau Jr. and Barack Obama. A bunch of smiley ways and sunshine and light replaces real policies. IN FACT he copied Obama's election slogan of Hope and Change and turned it into Real Change. Stephanie Dion is not real change. Canadians rejected Dion a decade ago.
5141,"'Most of the Syrians we see on the nightly news and on newspaper front pages are not fleeing war-torn Syria. The three-year-old Aylan Kurdi (his real name is Alan Shenu) whose heartrending death was broadcast around the world was not fleeing Syria. He’d lived his whole short life in Turkey, where his parents had been living in safety. The Shenu family, like so many of these refugees, left Turkey on a smugglers’ boat, ultimately trying to reach Canada in pursuit of better economic prospects and a better life.'http://www.nationalreview.com/article/423848/europe-migrant-crisis-refugees-germany?target=author&tid=897"

841,Cant have a fake Climate Tax with out fake Scientists.
6708,Thanks Jeffery. Don't stop skewering this so-called Conservative government's hypocrisy. Canada continues to seriously go off the rails as long as these extremists are in power. STOP HARPER!
10263,"Nice hatchet job on Trudeau Wente. Cherry picking at its finest. 'This is the approach advocated by the nation’s police chiefs, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s government adopt it.' Really? That would be quite the change up. right now he is trying to jail and take private property,(including houses) away right across the country form anyone that anyone that has six pot plants."
11584,"Read Ms W's column with interest; it is up to the good sense of the American people to see thru the veneer of Mr T and see the substance of the man - but wait! I fear the veneer and the substance are one and the same. On a somewhat unrelated matter I see it is no longer sufficient for me to describe my gender in those simple terms; no, I am no longer simply a male, rather I am not transgendered (cisgendered). Please, a little sanity."
883,"margaret, as a climate change denier would any form of control not 'bomb' for you?"
11917,I guess this is another fail for the Globe and the liberals considering the news today.
1354,"Perps of the Boston Marathon bombings would never have been caught had they been wearing ski masks. I believe in religious freedom, but I also believe in social responsibility. Besides, Canada stands for gender equality. Why would women who subject themselves to this archaic repression even want to live here?"
355,"Can't argue with much of this, Jeffery, right down to your final comment that it's a mystery why Conservatives continue to be seen as good fiscal managers. Good op-ed to drag out in support of merger or coalition of progressives, from both the Liberals and NDP, under a new banner; perhaps the Progressive Democrats of Canada. Makes perfect sense to me and would force both parties to compromise, and, thus, rediscover the common ground on which most of their fellow Canadians have always stood, while, at the same time, facilitate the purging of elements of the extreme left, as in the NDP's case, and elements of the right, as in the 'blue' Liberal case."
10362,"We have watched this for years, look at all the empty retail spaces in the West End , owned by foreign investors. It is sad, but look at the politicians who made money. We can't forget that the mayor of my fair city, Gregor, made money from his own home and also has a girlfriend, if I am correct, who's mother is in Jail in China for some fraud type real estate problem. It is also too bad that the Vancouver Sun is funded , in my opinion , by real estate developers and actually promotes the bubble almost every day instead of reporting news."
7569,"Despite pleadings to the contrary, there's an inevitable cost to 'leadership' in green energy. Here are some US c/kwh rates for electricity by country: Denmark - 40.4Germany - 36.3Ontario - 11.2http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_pricing"

9123,There always seems to be a group of people around us who are afflicted with that personality disorder which compels them to tell everyone else how to speak/act/think. Back in the sixties it was the little old lady spying with binoculars through her kitchen blinds. Today it's the 20-something SJWs.
6357,"'respect for life' Always a dig for born again values. The Manning centre is anything but democratic. They create policy when not democratically asked for and then leak it to the press as if it is in fact the policy the public wants. Democracy is by the people, not by a special interest group who charges fee for service to train and lobby for candidates of their choosing. This is the religious right moment that we see doing so much damage south of the border."
2738,"Well First of all Justin is incapable of thought. That being said, without a nicely rehearsed speech the true JT has been shown for all to see."
3682,"'Canada is back' Trudeau proclaims - back to being irrelevant. I suspect Obama, Cameron, Hollande etc, view him as a naive rube."
2550,Any book that asks Canadians to freeze in the dark for the sake of people in Africa is not going to convince me to do a thing. The whole con is an effort to take money from those who have it and give it to those who haven't earned it.
1823,Readers: Welcome to the Donald Sutherland love-in comments section.
2737,What do voters expect when they elect a pre-pubescent imbecile ?
4772,Seems the media elites are a little bitter.
3839,Who didn't saw this coming?
2938,He is absolutely correct.
7746,"In your dreams Margaret, say hello to president Trump"
834,"Better update your password quickly Amanda Lang, I think Kevin O'Leary has hacked your account and he wrote this disgusting piece putting your name to it. You're going to be pretty p'ed with him on Monday when you realise."
9120,"I disagree with Harper on so much, but on this issue I'm with him 100%. Compare the openness of our society to say Saudi Arabia or Pakistan or for that matter any Muslim dominated society. Have a women drive a car in Saudi or wear shorts in Iran to see how much freedom they have there. Absolutely none of these countries would allow any of our beliefs to have precedence but this issue is really about the fact our society is different to theirs and we all should celebrate that fact. If that is not why they came to our country then they really should not stay. Our customs and beliefs while flexible cannot be totally mutable. It is not that these folks want religious freedom it is that they want to impose their beliefs on us. And we have no right to question what they do."
6687,"Wow, reading these comments makes me think I'm reading comments over at the National Post. Please, lets not dumb these boards down THAT much. Debate some real information. Please."
3217,There are 600 native bands in Canada with some only haveing a few hundred people. Here is BC the entire province is claimed by natives. You can't get a treaty because one band disputes the territory of another band. We even have natives coming across the Canadian border to vote in Canada on treaty lands. There will never be treaties because the natives don't care about the other bands - it is only what is in it for us.
8079,"I find some of the reactions very offensive, but not perhaps for the expected reasons. Women are not collectively weak, sacred vessels who need to be protected from the real world. Most of the women that I know, whatever their age, are strong, independent individuals who are well able to make their way in the world. Were the Facebook comments stupid and degrading? Yes, of course they were. Unfortunately there are stupid people in the world (and not all of them are men). But if we are all to be judged by our worst moments, we'll all surely be found wanting."
4977,'Manifesto' is a poor word to choose. It can have a sinister connotation.
10166,Of course Canadian federalism has been hijacked by an ideologue would be dictator backed by a minority. The provinces shoot themselves in the foot by having no workable interprovincial trade deal. Responsibility for things like health care or the environment are tossed about like political hot potatoes so nothing or worse gets done. 'Have' provinces are encouraged to excoriate 'have nots' rather than work together to mutual advantage.... Canada is perhaps the luckiest country in the world but even the luckiest can push it too far. Lots of work to do yet.
4289,"All the comments on here attack O'Leary personally. They don't go into whether or not he is correct, that carbon taxes and corporate taxes are supremely ill-timed and could be disastrous. I would only be guessing but I'd have to wonder if this same columnist was against the GM bailouts after the 2008 crisis. Funny how a bunch of big corporations with unionized workers in Ontario should get a lifeline from the government, while corporations in trouble in Alberta that are largely free enterprise and non-union should get hit over the head with a tax. And not sure why personal attacks on O'Leary constitute a valid discussion of government policy or, as I said, whether he is right or wrong."
11043,"Ummm, sure. And to whom would Hair Harper pass his combustible torch? Jason 'temporary foreign workers' Kenney? Half wit, Peter 'F35's are free' Mckay? Loudmouth John Baird still barking for war in Ukraine and falling on his knees for the Saudis? And most important for Harper - who would spend hours doing his wig and makeup on a daily basis if he stepped down and we taxpayers were no longer picking up the bill? The humanity! And ya never know Harper might just get a pipeline through, somewhere, at some time, maybe. And then a seat on the board of an oil company would be assured and Harper could still get his hair and makeup subsidized! Win win."
5278,"So little known about the Cologne events and so much assumed! Newspapers are running with amplified rumours, some claiming 1000 men surrounded women and assaulted them in various ways. There was immediate jumping to conclusion that the assaulters were 'asylum seekers' as if that could be known from looking at a person. On the news (CBC radio) I hear that among the few arrested so far were an American and British man, so perhaps we need to wait a little longer for the FACTS about the situation rather then wallowing in moral panic and (anti-Muslim, anti-alien) hysteria. We also start hearing that the assaults were connected to pickpocketing, as the railway station is a haven for such folks, a well-known fact in Cologne, so perhaps more thefts and robberies than sexual assaults. I also need to ask, why, oh why, are there no video and photo images from the event, when probably every person present had a cellphone or camera?"
1725,reading this article... one realizes how out of touch the Conservative Party of Canada was... somehow it was all about the campaign... and not the hideous corruption and how Harper treated Canadians like idiots
2319,The mass commercialization and promotion of marijuana would significantly increase health and safety costs to Canadian society. The combination of tobacco and marijuana takes the risks of a premature death from 50 to 80%. Good public health policy would not create a profit driven commercial marijuana industry that would drive down the price and accelerate the market - surely to catch up youth. Justin Trudeau missed his opportunity to call for a return of funding to tobacco prevention agencies which the Harper Government has gutted and to call for soberserious conversation such as Patrick Kennedy and Dr. Kevin Sabet have been conducting in the USA. The best thing Justin Trudeau could do is pick up the phone and talk to Patrick Kennedy - he might take the call after all Patrick's wife is a Canadian. He has time to sort out this mess he has now placed the Liberal Party in but the hours are counting down.
2010,"So the groper/rapist gets his jollies, and every one of his compatriots will know the sting of vigilante justice. Smart move guys, it's only going to get much worse for you now. Ironic how we value the rights of these foreign guests, when in their home countries we would be afforded no such protections, legally or morally."
11421,"Good article. Canada has always 'gone shopping' for immigrants who would do the jobs that people here did not want to do, or were not able to do, whether they were Scots, or Portuguese, or Italians or 'East Indians.' They (our ancestors or the ancestors of our friends and neighbours) worked their butts off farming, or smelting, sometimes dreaming of eventually making enough money to go 'home,' but in the meantime, marrying and having the babies that became us - lazy middle class Canadians. The one exception, is the temporary workers that we're still apologizing for ad nauseum - the Chinese railway workers. So if we need workers now, we should continue to 'go shopping' for immigrants, who will continue to make our country what it is, and not exploit foreign workers for future politicians to apologize for. And if you don't like it, all I can say is that if your people arrived after 1852 when the first of mine came over to work their butts off, you should be grateful that:'We let you in, didn't we?'"
10609,Who exactly is 'poised ' to take in more Syrians? Not me or anyone I know for that matter. Canada has enough internal issues and a huge deficit... lets deal with those first.
10510,I'd welcome an election now to throw out the Harper regime. One remark* from Trudeau is not enough to undo my appreciation for his fundamental values and his capacity to surround himself with very smart people. I will vote for him enthusiastically.*with which many Canadians - especially younger ones - agree
7836,I guess she is talking about the greeters at Walmart.
8953,"Wonderful insight, an enjoyable read."
5507,"'War on science'? Do those 'progressives' want to deny science? No, they just don't trust it or don't trust those who claim to speak for it.

3137,Some years ago Wente could have written such an article about sipping wine and enjoying the good life in south Africa while the bad guys-obviously she considers them rabble-were kept at bay so as not to disturb the colonists. South Africa used to offer lots of free trips in exchange for the kind of inane propaganda offered by Wente in this article.. What is sad is that it is not only disastrous for the Palestinians but for the Israelis as well as every chance for peace disappears with each new settler house . Those Israeli voices that see where this will end are drowned out in the interests of the Sehldon Adelson funded extreme settler group which holds the reins in Israel today thanks largely to support from North America. For Canada to pander to this destructive movement is sad. As for Wente she forfeited any credibility a long time ago .

The UN is doing nothing but taking OUR money & doing nothing but having conversations. Yeah, the new millennium power word'conversations'. There are quite a few countries who have applied work & transformed desert into lush farmland, yet these reporters fail to address this.

Houellebecq was right - the West is doomed.
10228,"No, I do not believe this is as good as it gets. I believe it got 'as good as it was going to get' about twenty years ago, over all. Despite some specific changes (the emergence of the internet being foremost in my mind) we've been diminishing our quality of life in the western world, and not really advancing the quality of life elsewhere since about 2000. Theoretically, there are no limits to growth. At best, however, I believe there are limits to the SPEED of economic growth (we are seeing this now) and in the future, we will regard economic growth as a fabled concept while the world's economic indicators continue to diminish, year after year, rendering today's debate over 'growth' moot. I believe the reversal of growth--with its many immediate (mostly negative) effects--will be incremental. This will be a slow process rather than an overnight apocalyptic event. Two trends are converging: technology and its creation, Big Data, which effects people's lives in ways we can barely comprehend (yesterday, on the factory floor, today and tomorrow, inside every floor in every downtown steel-and-glass tower.) and our continued estrangement from the natural world, through plunder, poisoning and benign neglect. The result: natural calamity, food shortages and human displacement beyond our imaginings. Does this usher in, eventually, a slower-paced, bucolic society in which (western-world) people, having lost their zeal and rationale for forming technology's 'future frontiers' stop and smell the roses, instead? Don't believe so. Most people didn't stop too long to smell many roses 120 years ago, as the 1800s became the 1900s (what many consider to be the start of the truly 'modern' technological era.) Many were too busy trying to survive. Our grandchildren may be preoccupied in a similar way."

1185,"Electoral reform in Canada is a solution desperately looking for an actual problem. Its indicative of this new Liberal government activist agenda which is entirely unfocused and scatter-brained. I give it two years before their agenda is a complete mess and nothing is getting accomplished. Electoral reform social engineers are trying to convince us the FPTP system we have used pretty successfully for the past 150 years is so flawed we need to invent a new one. This will almost certainly just add a whole new layer of inequities. No voting process is without inequities. There is no magic solution. But hey, lets change ours anyway. The most glaring red flag thus far are the many statements from senior Liberals dismissing any notion of a public referendum. Think about that for a moment. The LPC wants to invent new rules for how we elect people and grant power in our democracy. They just don't want the voters to actually approve or disapprove of that before the next election. Many folks are so besotted by this new PM they apparently have no problem with this. Never mind the LPC has a proud tradition of doing whatever it takes to hold onto power. I'm sure I will be accused on this post for being a Harperite Con, a Neo this and Neo that. That is the typical response from those bowing down to kiss the feet of Justin against anyone who dare speak of a little common sense on this electoral reform issue."

1032,"Are you sure. Pathetic in the research department The only official definition of Fascism comes from Benito Mussolini, the founder of fascism, in which he outlines three principles of a fascist philosophy. 1.'Everything in the state'. The Government is supreme and the country is all-encompasing, and all within it must conform to the ruling body, often a dictator. 2.'Nothing outside the state'. The country must grow and the implied goal of any fascist nation is to rule the world, and have every human submit to the government. 3.'Nothing against the state'. Any type of questioning the government is not to be tolerated. If you do not see things our way, you are wrong. If you do not agree with the government, you cannot be allowed to live and taint the minds of the rest of the good citizens. The use of militarism was implied only as a means to accomplish one of the three above principles, mainly to keep the people and rest of the world in line. Fascist countries are known for their harmony and lack of internal strife. There are no conflicting parties or elections in fascist countries. Nazi Germany was extreme Fascism, better examples of fascist countries were Mussolini's Italy, Iraq, Iran, and many middle eastern countries."

It turned this election into a referendum on the one-man show that has become the Harper government.'Harper has damaged our democracy. You can't distinguish between supporting the Conservatives and supporting Harper himself. As your own editorial acknowledges, this Government is a one-man show.

3248,"Everyone should read Brooke Jeffrey's book 'Dismantling Canada' as it is a stunning documentation of how Harper has declared war on the LPC and liberalism in this country, just how successful he has been at destroying it and replacing it with American Republican values and strategies. His Americanization of the country should in itself be an election issue. The coming election is pivotal in that it might very well mark the death of the party and our liberal values. The present LPC has positioned itself poorly to have any hope of winning this election, so, ironically, the NDP by default becomes the standard -bearer for liberalism in the country. Ultimately the persistence of liberalism in Canada will be determined by our resistance to neoliberalism which is the veiled eradicator of liberalism. Harper is clearly a neoliberal, so too the present incarnation of the LPC, as was the Chretien government. Should Mulcair end up as PM the measure of his success would be how strongly he would resist neoliberalism. Neoliberalism is the taboo subject of our political dialogue and until we address it openly and decisively liberalism is down for the count in Canada and so many other countries."

Has Mr. Yakabuski interviewed a representative sample of young iPhone users to determine their employment status, living arrangements, and parental income? I doubt it. This has little or nothing to do with logic, and everything with ideologically-rooted preconceptions."
7209,"This is a frustrating article written with bias. There are certainly issues with the Green Energy Act but it is critically important to meet green house gas emission reduction needs. Some errors: solar does not have a high failure rate, wind is far more unreliable than solar, solar produces 35% or more of its output during peak demand (when it is needed most and electricity often costs more than the tariff), solar has not been built on good farmland, the green energy act has not contributed in any significant way to increases in electricity costs. The Green Energy Act needs to be modified to more accurately reflect the reality of our energy needs. Wind and ground mount solar have to be governed by municipal planning controls. There is no further need for large scale wind in Ontario. Commercial roof top solar has to be given priority in a non biased tariff allocation process. This application acts as a form of conservation, can be covered by a slightly modified net-metering program, has other benefits such as reducing heat island effect and has the advantage of providing a more open and fair market place than large solar or wind."

3190,"Jeffrey Simpson here conflates two quite separate debates: 1. How should the NATO, Russian and other allied outside interveners in the Syrian/Iraq proceed against ISIL (and the Assad regime?)?2. How should Canada contribute to the NATO intervention? Regarding the NATO and related outside intervention, there are clearly limits to the possible success of high altitude air strikes against presumed ISIL targets in the absence of credible domestic ground forces in Syria and Iraq to confront ISIL militarily and politically. While the Assad regime, the Kurds and the Iranian and Hezbollah allies of the Assad regime do manage to hold ISIL somewhat at bay in Syria, serious policy and military confrontations ensue with Turkey and NATO objectives and Sunni Arabs, who constitute about 70% of Syria’s population are increasingly alienated by the actions of that Assad related alliance’s policies and actions. This alienation is mirrored in the Sunni Arab regions of northern Iraq, where incursions by Shi’ite militias nominally supporting the ineffective Shi’ite dominated Iraqi Government (but controlled and augmented by the Iranians) make little headway against ISIL. The Kurds in Iraq are effective in repelling ISIL from Kurdish majority areas and, like their brethren in Syria, are the one generally effective moderate element (although, there are increasing reports that Kurdish fighters are taking harsh reprisals against Arab Sunni residents whenever they retake areas from ISIL), but there is every indication that if and when the forces nominally supporting the Iraqi regime and the Kurdish fighters are able to link up on the ground, they will come into serious conflict. In the context just described, NATO aerial bombing too often is based upon inadequate local intelligence and lacks credible on the ground consolidation by anti ISIL forces. It can disrupt ISIL movements and destroy ISIL supplies and infrastructure and kill ISIL fighters and leadership to some extent, but not fatally to the ISIL cause and only at the cost of (a) further alienation of the Iraqi and Syrian Sunni Arab populations, (b) risk of NATO confrontation with the Russian and Iranian interveners, and (c) propping up the Assad and Iraqi regimes that both are clearly willing and unable to reach out to the domestic Sunni Arab (and, in the case of the Iraqi regime, the Kurdish) elements of their nations. More damningly, the NATO bombing program in the current circumstances can legitimately be characterized as an attempt, in the absence of a viable policy, for western Governments to give the appearance to (a) their own domestic audiences the appearance of ‘doing something’ and reeking vengeance upon ISIL, and (b) other players in the Iraq/Syria arena, that NATO is engaged. In this context, ISIL can goad the NATO nations to ever greater bombing efforts, which is clearly ISIL’s goal. Regarding Canada’s role, our token current air strike involvement does not enhance NATO efforts and for Canada to simply continue that element of our involvement because that will not draw further attention to any reservations Canada may have about the questionable utility of current NATO policy is no favour to our allies. Joining the majority of NATO nations that currently focus their efforts on humanitarian aid and, in some cases, on well designed and executed training and logistic support of credible, moderate domestic opponents on the ground in Iraq and Syria is the way to go, especially now that Canada has already announced this policy shift."

Therefore it is especially important to have consectutive sentences for mutliple crimes.

Our system of electing our government is owned by the people, not the government of the day, and therefore every citizen of the country deserves their say, not a few forums in a few cities and town in the middle of summer when people are away at the cottage! Totally undemocratic in every way!"

9277,"The gun problem in this country is, the government says some guns are too dangerous for me to own. Like a .22 cal pistol with a 4' barrel. When at the same time I can own a .44 magnum if I want to. Just as long as the barrel is 4.2' long. Or that it's a public safety issue if I want to take my .22 pistol to the woods for animal dispatch, or plinking tin cans, but I can take a .30-06 rifle which has 10 times the potential for harm if misused. The key here is misuse. Responsible gun owners are being punished pre-emptively for something that someone might do, instead of just punishing those individuals who actually do wrong. In the meantime, urban gang bangers just laugh at our revolving-door court system."

And those studies that say that it aids in intellectual development should be ignored. And parents don't really care about French immersion, it's all peer pressure. As a parent of French immersion kids, I can assure you that Ms.Wente's piece is complete and utter nonsense.

Canada is very torn regionally . the country is an artificial construct , and what someone from Vancouvers West End has in common with someone from rural New Brunswick is declining with time rather than growing. all regions look t the central government to solve a list of problems. the central government has limited power to solve those problems. so you get what we got.. and should Mr Mulcair become Prime Minister there will be the same kind of yelling at him as with Mr Harper ' closed , non transparent , deaf to the concerns of you name it area, poor manager of all things money'"

If they truly believe the opinion they just published, why did they not complete their thought and assay anybody who owns a business must sell it when they get elected.

Unfortunately, a number of those sources don't say what Wente says they do or don't back up her thesis. For example:'... Kenneth Zucker, a renowned U of T psychiatry professor, was fired from his position at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health... ' But he continues to work as a prof for the U of T, so presumably they didn't find his 'anti-radicalism' a problem.'According to studies of U.S. universities, 18 per cent of social-sciences professors say they're Marxists.' If you click the link, you'll see it's actually one study that says this and it's a 2007 working paper which appears never to have been published but which gets frequently cited by conservative journalists and conservative academics. See you later, Margaret. I'm going to leave this liberal rag and go read the real news over at Breitbart."

I thought all the bad decisions I was surrounded by were due to alcohol and poor economy. When I moved to Norway, I saw the same bad decisions being played out in dive bars across the city. This was strange. Norway is a social democracy with generous benefits. Everyone lives well above the poverty line - is there a poverty line in a social democracy? So why would people, with enough money and good jobs, make these same bad decisions that are rampant in my small Northern Ontario town? Social capital. Even still, we all have choices. I did not graduate high school. I attempted suicide when studying for a biology test at 16 years old. A few months later I moved to Toronto and lived through a string of bad relationships. I was always smart, winning awards, captain of sports teams, but at some point, my lack of social capital caught up to me. Now I live in Norway and will defend my PhD in Medicine in early April. We all have choices. We all have free will. We can choose to suffer or work our butts off for a better life. We can build our own social capital, one book at a time."

Government employees can retire after twenty-five to thirty years service at age fifty or fifty-five; while the rest of us along with millennials have to work until age 70 to pay for these pensions as well as supporting ourselves. Canada has become a rigged game and I fully support the underground economy because its the only way for a private sector worker to survive."

In addition to Mr. Wall's objections to carbon pricing in this article, he also contends that that carbon pricing would make many small carbon producing companies un-competitive.

Mr. Wall is free to return any portion he wishes of the revenue his province will receive from carbon pricing to whomever he wishes, but he apparently assumes that voters in his province don't."

You talk about 'Christians ... routinely [engaging] in war and violence in the name of 'God'.' Routinely? Really? Name the last one? The last one I can think of is the INTERNAL war waged INSIDE Catholicism against perverse priests abusing children. They saw there was internal rot, and they dealt with it. Who in the Muslim community has taken the radical Imams to task? When will that be front-page news? Women in India (and Pakistan let's not forget!) surely live in a terrible way ... but the men of India don't scour the globe looking for targets. It makes their INTERNAL actions no less despicable, but it is hardly comparable to bombing the World Trade Center and shouting 'God is Great' ... and then watching the jubilation on the streets as the entire Muslim community celebrates. The issue is getting lost here. The point is that Sheema's ending comment is bang-on ... only, IMHO, applies to the ENTIRE Mulsim community, not just the ones in the West."

Like a lot of people who write well, he is so much in love with his own writing he would rather write a stinging phrase than make sure it reflected the truth. It was written days after the debate in St. Louis, where Trump spotlighted Kathy Shelton, Paula Jones and Juanita Broaddrick. Kathy Shelton was the accuser in a 1975 rape trial where lawyer Hillary Clinton represented the defendant. So it is bizarre for him to say that he was negligent in attacking Clinton because the Donald's campaign had to be all about himself. Does Orwin miss Hillary Clinton, the former ****-Shamer-in-Chief?"

1151,"The optics of this is so bad on so many levels and not just because Justin said the rich shouldn’t have subsidies for their children. At this point in the political honey moon, the left leaning media won't do much about this, i.e., create a Nanny-gate. However, this is just another example of how we have just elected as Prime Minster, a spoiled rich kid with an exaggerated sense of entitlement. Not to mention his wife Sophie. Harper was accused of creating a “Presidential” Prime Minsters office. Well Sophie seems to have cast herself as a First Lady, so we have to pay to take care of the kids. I am not saying that Sophie shouldn’t have a job, of course she should. But if she had a real job, working in the private sector instead of Globe-trotting with Justin at tax payer’s expense, would we still be expected to foot the bill for childcare? Who is to blame for this predicament? Well, we are, because we elected Justin (No one elected Sophie). But to satisfy the left leaning media, let’s blame the Harper Tory's for not providing a viable alternative. It might be worth telling Justin to smarten up, but we already know that he is nowhere as near as smart as his father, so what’s the point."

Some of us don’t even look that old (or so we fool ourselves).'----------------------------------------------...and a great many of you are also being cast into old folks' homes by your ungrateful, spoiled boomer/gen-x kids, left to the ravages of Alzheimer's and dementia."
4082,"1. White guy here -- and I had a hard time understanding why the 'All Lives Matter' response is unhelpful until someone posted this analogy: Lets say we all sit down to dinner. All of us in this thread. The food gets past around and we all fill our plates. But for some reason -- accidental or intentional -- one of us gets passed over and their plate remains empty. They (understandably) pipe up and say, 'Hey, I deserve food!'And I respond by saying, 'Actually, we ALL deserve food.'Both statements are true. But one of us still has an empty plate while the rest of us are reaching for seconds. The better response, the more compassionate response, the response that is actually listening to what the other person is saying, is along the lines of:'Here, have the mashed potatoes.'and'How did that happen? Never mind, someone pass him the the roast beef.'and'Now, does everyone have food? Okay, lets eat!'So try to let go of all the negative and divisive rhetoric that we so quickly throw at each other and let that sink in. When someone says Black Lives Matter, its not exclusionary. It doesn't contain an implicit 'only'. The fact that we hear and interpret it to mean 'Only Black Lives Matter' says more about how we've come to believe there is a limited amount of equity in the world, and for someone to get theirs I have to give up some of mine. This is simply not true. Just like when we say 'save the whales' we're not saying 'screw the dolphins'."

135,"Maybe, Canada's aging population and the under-sixty-fives' indifference to federal politics explains the decline of the Liberal Party. For decades, the Liberals preached entitlement as the reason for voting Liberal. These days, 'entitlement' is a nasty word among senior voters and not very popular with the few non-seniors who bother to vote. If the Liberals had stuck with a hard working politician like Bob Rae rather than the unproven son of a former populous PM, I believe their rating in the polls today would be in over 50% based on the Conservatives past record and the NDP's future promises. Instead, we have 3 main parties running neck and neck all all claiming entitlement to the middle ground of Canadian voters. My MP polls me 3 times a month to find out where that middle ground is. Shouldn't he be telling me what I'll be getting if I vote for him in October?"
2243,"what bothers me most about Mr Lewis , Ms Klein and the various types who have latched on to the promotion of this Manifesto, is the jaw-dropping deception. Where Mr Lewis says in this article :'What makes the Leap different is that it connects the dots, showing how all these demands are integral to a fair and ambitious response to climate change. It’s not a list – it’s a story.' what he really means of course is that the Manifesto, as cribbed from his wife Naomi Klein's book, ' This changes Everything' requires that to win the war against climate change we must first or at least simultaneously, win the war against society's social ills and affronts....only then can the world save itself from the ravages of an oncoming catastrophe... in essence, to save itself from a technical problem, the over-release of carbon to the atmosphere, the world must create a new highly integrated social and economic model which replaces as a priority , almost all alignment to free market Capitalism. Where have I heard that determination before... without the new upgraded existential threat to life on the planet link to climate change of course... where..."

He knows who the enemies are and he knows that the global warming alarmists are full of BS. He is wrong on the pot issue, but pretty much right with most other issues. Much-hair will sink the ship, Justin Clouseau will burn it to the water level. Harper will keep it afloat.

And in the sober cold light of day appreciated it was still something they would never do again. And time with that thought increased angst and anger. Which could make both sides of the story true to some extent, an option not widely dispersed by pundits as I have read so far. Most do tend toward this authors description of looking for the black or white of the matter, very elusive indeed. My guess is we will never really know any more than what we have now."
11383,"You compare the fraudulent admissions to a coal plant. A more relevant comparison would be to the oil sands: how much oil sands oil would need to be produced (vs. light oil from the middle east) to be equivalent of the VW fraudulent emissions. After all, a large number of Canadians seem willing to sacrifice the oil sands, while their choice of car may matter more."
9135,"And one more point to consider about the data which the conclusion in this article is based on. The authors are referring to 'fuel' and, referring again to Dr. Elgie's paper, the authors are referring only to fuel which is subject to the carbon tax. Natural gas is NOT subject to the carbon tax. So the authors are NOT considering natural gas consumption. This skews the data because BC consumes far less heating oil on a per capita basis than the eastern provinces. According to Natural Resources Canada, 'Due to the abundant supply of natural gas in Western Canada, relatively little furnace oil is consumed in this region. The western provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan) account for only 6 per cent of the furnace oil consumption in Canada. In contrast, Atlantic Canada (where natural gas is not an option in many markets) accounts for over 30 per cent of Canada's furnace oil consumption despite representing only 7 per cent of the Canadian population. Although Atlantic Canada consumes the most furnace oil on a per capita basis, Ontario and Quebec account for the majority (63 percent) of Canadian consumption measured in absolute terms.'Perhaps the authors ought to substitute the quote from Mark Twain with the quotation often attributed to Disraeli: '...lies, damned lies, and statistics.'"

Carbon tax is another gov't tax grab that has not helped except to increase the cost of goods and and services. It works well if your in metropolitan area that has mass transit. Or small countries where you can pretty much walk across the country in 7 days. Or I wonder if Simpson ever thought that maybe. Just maybe.

Voter apathy becomes low voter turnout until finally a candidate comes along like Trump who tells it like it is.It's like an epiphany .Hey, it's not hopeless Afterall !We have a real candidate at long last who speaks our lingo and understands our passions and hopes.

Whether it's assassinating Julian Assange, 'assimilating' first nations people (ask a Jew what that means) or that just looking at pictures of child abuse is a victimless crime, Flanagan can hold and espouse all the ludicrous views he wants, However the rest of us are under no obligation to fund or otherwise provide ways for Flanagan to espouse these views, especially when it's something as morally reprehensible or demonstrably false as his views on images of child abuse. He is being held to account for holding and espousing these views.'Conservatives' like Flanagan, French and others need to figure out that accountability isn't just something for minorities and poor people. Accountability is for well off, morally bankrupt, white men as well, and guess what, it doesn't mean the same as 'unquestioning validation'."

9028,"The ignorance abounds! The current BC Teacher’s Strike is important for restoring reasonable class size and composition to our Public Schools, but I am most afraid because the actions of the BC Liberals in this fight attack the very heart of Canadian Democracy, and Charter Rights for all Canadians ( whether Union, non-union, public or private). The Liberal government’s continuing refusal to respect the Charter Rights of BC teachers ( in essence, the Charter Rights of ALL Canadians), and their refusal to respect two Supreme Court Rulings, and their use of taxpayers money, in what is, in essence, an attempt to dismantle the people’s own Charter Protections. 'Griffin’s ruling in the Supreme Court decision between the teachers and the govenment described part of what was at stake in this legal case as being Canada’s democratic structure itself, “which requires that governments must act legally, within the supreme law of the country, the Constitution.” Discussing the historical context for her decision, she wrote that political forces often desire “to consolidate and gather more power and to seek to diminish any restraint on that power.” Conversely, she wrote, “A democratic system has institutional checks to counter that tendency and to safeguard against tyranny.” She cited the moral and legal context for her determination as government conduct that could be placed somewhere on a spectrum between negligent “wilful blindness” and a clearly wrong “abuse of power.” And without substantial penalties for such actions, she argued, it was simply “too tempting” for governments to dismiss and extinguish the basic civil rights of the governed. How much more dire a warning about our government could a high-ranking representative of our judiciary give us?' 1. Also; as there appears to be so much diversionary tactics from the real issues at stake by manipulating the public into thinking this fight is about teacher’s wages; perhaps a little real Math would help there: As any grade six student knows, you do not calculate percentage totals of two different variables by adding them. An 8% raise on salary, and a 6.5% raise on benefits DOES NOT EQUAL a 14.5% raise as the government claims teacher’s are asking for. A % is out of 100. Two variables ( salary plus benefits) cannot be added to get a % total. Similar to two items of $100 each, for sale at 8% for one, and 6.5% for the other; you don’t TOTAL them to get 14.5% off at the cashier. You would get $14.50 of $200. That means you have an average between the 2 variables of 7.25% in total. (in ref to a wage increase %, spread over 5 years as proposed, that is not even cost of living). Clearly, presenting this sort of Math in explanation to the Public regarding Teacher salary wage ‘demands’ is HIGHLY SUSPECT, given Liberal history in dealing with the BC Teachers. Alarming, this gov disrespect for our countries highest law; our constitution, and in it’s deliberate manipulations of facts. 1. Rob Wipond"

Some of these persons are being hit with devastating financial penalties and criminal charges for failing to report their retirement accounts to U.S. Treasury when they don't even live in U.S.A. and some of them are too stupid to just say NO. Others were tricked into confirming U.S.A. citizenship when they were tricked into obtaining a U.S.A. passport. This will drain money from the Canadian economy. That's okay with the Conservatives. Where are the Liberals and NDP? Don't take silence as an answer. Silence means cowardice at best. They are FOR the FATCA-enabling Canadian legislation until they establish otherwise. The Green Party is against the FATCA-enabling legislation. Elizabeth May, MP, leader of the Green Party, was born in Connecticut and is a Canadian now. Now, if the Liberals or NDP make a firm commitment to oppose the FATCA-enabling Canadian legislation (which would leave Canadian banks free choose whether to comply or to divest their U.S. assets) then I'm staying out of the issue of WHICH anti-FATCA party should get your vote. Until then, I'm saying, don't vote for anybody who supports the FATCA-enabling legislation and don't donate to their campaigns, either."

The U.S. with its race riots and which wants to build a wall to keep out the Mexicans and won't bring in gun laws no matter how many children get shot to death in their classrooms? Australia, which was white-only until the 1970s and still harbors rampant racism which you pick up on after about an hour of being in the place. Canada does okay -- people from other cultures are safe here, we offer public health care, we do a pretty good job of not ghettoizing people, women have a world-leading level of equality, we have public housing, etc. etc. We're not perfect but the list of countries that do a better job than us of accommodating a multicultural population is pretty darn short.

This could have happened under any other democratic or republican president. Russia has been continually losing influence over the last 10-20 years. Right or wrong, they don't like it and they fear NATO. Putin is able to turn any country (including the USA) into a parking lot in short order.

403,"I really have to wonder how deep the control over the media is or how dumb most reporters are? How can anyone in their right mind say that America was EVER great? A nation built on the backs of slaves, a nation that continues to use black Americans as free labour through a system that was created to target black Americans for imprisionment once it became obvious that it just wasn't socially acceptable to have slaves anymore. A nation who no longer allows a person who has been released from the prison system to ever vote! A country that allows its public to go into massive debt to pay basic health care needs, a country that has stolen so much from aboriginal people and continues to do so today. I'm sorry, what part of any of that was great? Any accomplishments that America has made in the last 200-300 years were made through suppression, theft, manipulation and greed. America is not a country.

Those commenting about how hard it is for young boys in today's schools and the generalization and specific examples with no inclusion of what led to that moment are truly unaware of the schools we teach in. Saying things like 'Boys have been fighting with pretend weapons since the dawn of time' doesn't make it correct and we should ask, 'Why?'All children need to play, not just boys. No child is forced to sit still in a school for six hours today. Pointing guns at people, real or fake is not nice. It should not be encouraged and is not appropriate, in schools or at home. Girls attend school today, along with boys (who have had the opportunity to attend since school was invented) Teachers try to exhibit and encourage respectful behaviour. If you feel that fighting and rough housing inside a classroom is appropriate, or acceptable for boys you have to seriously imagine it happening with 26 other boys and girls and see how long you'd let it go on?What we as a society need to do is STOP isolating genders and create places of learning where all can achieve without wasting time analyzing which gender is doing better. I believe our schools are trying to do this. Using examples of isolated suspension incidents from the United States that you have no background on, compared to the millions of school children in Canada you could have sourced, makes this article not relevant at all to the audience you reach. It just soothes those who feel their little boy's misbehaviour in school is justified."

Those muslim female hospital employees were not objecting to the “no-long-sleeves” directive on the grounds that the science behind it was faulty, but rather because the misogynistic religion they have been indoctrinated with has told them they are not allowed to show their bare forearms to people other than their husbands. Consequently, the ugly issue of a demand for special exemptions because of one’s religion remains on the table and unanswered. “But religion is not illogical or unscientific.” Yep, and fire does not burn, we don’t need air to live, a horse is not an animal. WOW, I can say all of these nonsensical things and, just by my saying so, they become true, right? WRONG. Religion is both illogical and unscientific and repeating something different a gazillion times will still not make it correct. “Science doesn't point the way anywhere. It just describes things.” Now, these two sentences of yours truly reveal the fathomless depth of your lack of knowledge of what science is and how it operates. The next “pearl of wisdom”: “By the way, the Father of Secularism is the famous Islamic scholar Ibn Rushd aka Averroes of the 12th century. Indeed, the West owes all it's Modern scientific knowledge to Islamic scholars.” The assertion in the first sentence is incorrect, some of Ibn Rushd’s writing show a secular bend but this the “Father of Secularism” does not make. The affirmation in the second sentence is downright ludicrous. Some 400 hundred years ago, Arabs were making major contributions in the fields of mathematics, astronomy, architecture; women had an esteemed position and high status both in the household and in society in general. Then islam gained a foothold and everything came to a grinding halt. Today, the Arab world under the yoke of islam produces virtually nothing in terms of patents, inventions, discoveries, advances or articles in science, medicine, technology, etc. Spain, for example (a country that is not exactly on the forefront of things in comparison to other European nations) publishes more books in one year than the entire muslim universe in a decade, in addition to which most books published in the Middle East are simply commentaries on and exaltations of the koran. And when it comes to patents, for instance, the situation is even worse, Spain – which ranks number 12 in the European Union regarding the volume of patents acquired – has been granted more patents in the last three years than all of the islamic countries in their entire history! That is what happens when religious doctrine dictates what can and what cannot. And that is why it is very important for us not to mince words and be highly critical of religious-based policies, mindsets and political parties."

It's their centuries' old right as an MP to bring any and all issues before the Commons. I may vehemently object to their views, but I certainly defend their right as elected MPs to voice them. Let these antediluvian bozos have their 15 seconds of fame. Once their motions are defeated, they can tell their special interest groups that they tried, and at the same time, democracy has been served. That Harper so tightly scripts and muzzles his ministers and caucus bodes ill for democratic government in Canada. I'm not so sure CPC attack ads ahead of, and during the next general election will be as successful as in the past. I wouldn't be surprised if an 'engineered' election call comes before October 2015.

American Founding Father and former President, John Adams, said, 'There has never been a democracy that did not commit suicide.' Death by overdose of personal ambition. Chased down by a draught of war. Topped off by copious amounts of religion. Bbuuuuuuuurrrrrp! In Canada it was death by multinational corporation. Somebody better subsume the body and do an autopsy.

The Liberals promise to withdraw them - which still hasn't happened - was just a campaign tactic to curry favour with the Left. It's not as if it was a major campaign issue. Trudeau could have easily promised that the decision on whether or not to continue the mission would be debated openly in parliament when the time came. The phrase 'restoring democracy' seems to ring a bell. The usual arguments for not bombing were part of the UK debate.'It doesn't work' 'civilians could get hurt' and 'It makes ISIS stronger' In Canada we add to that - 'Six jets can't do much anyway' Hilary Benn's impassioned words swept away all of those points. Of course bombing isn't THE solution, it is ONE method of denying ISIS their expansionist dream. Trudeau claims that we'll remain a supporter of the coalition so withdrawing jets will not carry any weight with ISIS. There will be no 'honest broker' opportunity for us. But we do send a message to our allies that while they may be willing to put armed forces in harm's way - we are not. Sure, maybe some don't care. But some do and in today's globalized world of international agreements you never know when sitting out the shooting war might cost us."

Any new technology will have challenges, but the National Academy of Sciences, MIT, and other bodies with no axes to grind say that fracking is safe.'Both MIT and the NAoS quoted a single Duke University report that said that is was not fracking per se that caused the release of methane into local drinking water aquifers, that it was 'faulty cement casing' around the gas well instead. That's like saying that the BP oil spill off Louisiana's coastline wasn't caused by drilling, but by a faulty cap on the well instead. Disingenuous much?"

Clowns like Toews and MacKay have constantly clumsily defended jam-packed, subversive pieces of omnibus legislation that have juvenile names like, 'Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act', 'Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act' and 'Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act'.

4418,"Given that the author is a professor and a researcher, perhaps she could start to seek objective truth rather than pre-conceived bias. My sense is that her pre-conceived 'truth' is that white police officers are racist and that as racists they take any and every opportunity to kill black people. No doubt there are racist police officers just as there are racist political activists but just as I would be reluctant to label every political activist as a racist, so too would I be reluctant to ascribe such beliefs to every or even a significant number of police officers. So, if the majority of police officers are not racists, then why are so many interactions between police and blacks 'uncomfortable'? Is there another reason? Perhaps its time that the researchers went on an elephant hunt. An elephant hunt, you say? Yes; lets look for the elephant in the room that nobody wants to admit is there or at least lets look to see if the elephant is really there. What's the elephant? Based on discussions that I once had with some police officers, it is the belief among police officers that black people (particularly in the USA) are much more likely than white or Asian people to be involved in criminal activity and are much more likely to be carrying illegal firearms. I suspect that it is this belief that generates the tension among police when dealing with blacks and not the colour of their skin. So professor, why don't you do some research on this. An answer either positive or negative could be useful in helping to resolve the problem. Remeber if you don't really know the problem, then you can't solve it"

The Liberal Government is acting on an election promise, demonstrating that if the political will exists, Canada can expedite the process of bringing in refugees. In addition, it frames the small minded, fear mongering North American conservative movement's xenophobic, racist based approach to Syrian Muslim refugees for what it is. Hateful! The Federal Government, the Provinces and the Mayors of most cities are working together to achieve this humanitarian goal, notwithstanding the Conservative few who have attempted to spoil the spirit of generosity through fear. A just society opens its doors to refugees, irrespective of race, and religion. Kudos to the new Liberal Government."

Either could have taken it away from 'secretive' PM Harper, maybe during the economy debate. Nail the guy, put him on the spot. But, no, they allowed Harper to take public ownership of it.

The G&M gave short shrift to the report today that the average person now pays more in tax than they pay for food, shelter and clothing combined. There is a number most people can wrap their heads around. Almost 44 cents of every dollar you earn goes to one or another level of government. Not only that but governments, almost all of them, cannot provided all they want and are running significant deficits, soon to be increased. We are all to happy to encumber the earnings of the next few generations so we can have what we want - vs. what we need- today. Sucks to be them it would appear. So we seem to applaud governments that give more money to parents, money sooner to seniors, in fact anything that they suspect will keep them in office. Governments cannot control the wages and benefits they pay to public sector employees. Salaries run ten percent higher than private sector wages, medical and dental benefits are, comparatively, generous beyond belief as are pension. Deathly silence from the editorial team on these issues. A minister has a car and driver. The car would likely get them where they need to go faster, more productively as they can work in the back seat, and at lower cost to the taxpayer. Why does a minister who likely flies first class and has free lounge access need an annual pass? Tax revenues should be treated with a whole lot more respect.

This week, though, she apparently is qualified to opine on the conclusions of a book about genetics and the link between genes and the sociocultural, but criticized those same progressive elites for being too darn close-minded to take a book like Nicholas Wade's seriously. My suggestion is this: Please, can we have someone who IS qualified to read these books also write their reviews? I feel like the G&M takes me for a fool."

Included in the group being interviewed were several young women who had lost limbs. The documentary was hosted by the lead actor from the Sopranos TV sries and it drove home the message of the collateral damage caused by warfare. I distinctly remember this young lady talking about patriotism and the adventure image as portrayed in some many movies, etc. After her first hand experience in warfare and with the loss of two limbs, her views on war changed 100%. Loss of limbs is one horror not to speak of torture, rape, beatings, etc, etc. I think documentaries like these should be publicized more to show young people what the true realities of warfare are for both genders."

11191,"One should begin an analysis of the current situation in the Middle East as being the psychotic breakdown of the Neolithic style of civilization, which operates social pyramid systems based on backing up lies with violence. In particular, one should BEGIN with the recognition that the events on 9/11/2001 were inside job, false flag attacks, done by Zionists, in order to blame on Muslims. Therefore, the War in Afghanistan and the War in Iraq were both wars based on deceits, serving ulterior purposes which are criminally insane. The basic systems are debt slavery, backed by wars based on deceits, which have generated number which are debt insanities, that are provoking death insanities. The bigger picture is that human civilization is controlled by the people who are the best at being dishonest, and backing that up with violence. At the present time, all NATO countries are controlled by an inconceivably corrupt and crazy monetary system, in which private banks get to make the public 'money' supply out of nothing as debts, while governments agree to go along with that, and force everyone else to operate inside of that fundamentally fraudulent financial accounting system. In that context, the biggest gangsters are the international bankers, the banksters, who effectively control the mass media, and their political puppets, whose only real job is to continue to fool enough of the people enough of the time, so that the established systems of legalized lies, backed by legalized violence, can continue to get BIGGER. However, the BIGGER PICTURE is that 'money' made out of nothing as debts has been 'paying' for the natural resources of the planet to be strip-mined at an exponential rate, which processes of turning natural resources into garbage and pollution as fast as possible is reaching real limits of diminishing returns. However, the established systems have no publicly acceptable ways to admit, address and adapt to those limits. Rather, everything that human civilization does is now based on attitudes of evil deliberate ignorance, since making 'money' out of nothing violates the basic laws of nature, and yet, as enforced frauds, actually controls what civilization DOES. What is really happening in the Middle East is the process of the international banksters, controlling their political puppets in NATO countries, while the mass media keep enough people brainwashed to believe in Huge Lies, in the form of political propaganda. No rational evidence nor logical arguments matter to the established systems! Their overall agenda during the next Century is to deliberately drive conditions to deteriorate sufficiently that it will be possible to use weapons of mass destruction, in order to mass murder most of the human population. The situation in the Middle East is actually based on runaway criminal insanities, whereby wars based on deceits are the only apparently 'practical' ways to resolve real problems, since no other ways are politically possible."

I was ashamed for our city by his frequent public displays of insensitivity to the LGBT community, of his failure to recognize, by assuming the office, of his position as a role model for community. We can and should expect more from any man or woman holding public office. I have compassion for any individual overwhelmed by their struggles against addiction and I am sorry for the loss his family has suffered. I wish them well.

I thought Conservatives more than anyone else got it, that they understood that, when it came to the idea of personal freedoms, I can walk down the street wearing a veil, barrel, thong, polka-dot dress, spinning bow tie.... anything I wanted to wear as long as I met the required local standards of modesty. After all, isn't it the whining 'lefties' of the land who are always telling us what to eat, what to wear, what to think, what to do with our bodies, etc.? Wasn't the whole point of being conservative to tell those busybodies to go take a leap because their social engineering doesn't trump my right to dress and act however I please? Guess not. I guess we now know what being a Conservative really means: it means you're eternally afraid of The Other, and willing to back a government that uses force against an 'alien' group, so long as it's someone else. It means knowing the country built on 150 years of law and accommodation can't possibly withstand the full force of the Communists... no, wait, the Chinese... make that the Japanese... whoops, no, that's last year's memo, I meant Muslims.

0,And this Conservative strategy has produced the angry and desperate wing-nuts like the fellow who called reporters 'lying pieces of Sh*t' this week.

Bringing this new passion of CPC for history into the ad picture overall, I see they have backed off from their desire to look at how history is taught in our schools. Smart move, because they were heading straight into a trap that Trudeau the former teacher could have easily set....Smart move, yes, but a sign they are not on their game at all. I would say Trudeau can mine this topic in general in various ways... Maybe we should view Trudeau's response to CPC from the perspective of Chretien's response to the earlier attack ad. Or maybe Trudeau should look again at Chretien's response and see what it might give him for ammunition...."

On the provincial landscape, Peter Lougheed, Bill Davis (and many others) were as well Statesmen and exemplified Canadian values of fair play, quite diplomacy, compromise, compassion and integrity.

Stop fighting the last ideological war. No one cares. (True, Ms Wente started that one)If the US is to be respected as a power in the world it has to say what it means, and mean what it says. Obama and Kerry have failed here miserably, and Ms Wente's column (and dozens of other pundits) have pointed this out. There are consequences to making loud noises about Syria, in which the US appears to have neither a national interest nor a horse in the race, and then backing-down in the most ignominious way. Iran is watching, and after many years of US pressure they have to be taking notes on how easy it may be to hoodwink Obama and Kerry. The world now needs to worry that if Iran gets aggressive, Obama and Kerry may believe they will have to over-react to anything Iran may do in a desperate effort to regain some sort of credibility. We can hope they keep a sock in it but that presumes they learn from this. That is one possible consequence of not thinking before you open your mouth, and Obama and Kerry are acting like teenagers in this regard. The Russians and Chinese are laughing, the Iranians and North-Koreans are intrigued, and the rest of the west is embarrassed. Pray (hard) for some adult supervision in Washington.

8367,"DUECK: 'Evangelicals who support the Republican nominee believe that their current status as a religious minority and their right to hold, and act on, minority views will be deeply affected by the next judicial appointments. So they are counting on his court selections to protect religious freedoms.'____________________________________________Two things: 1) Christians are not a minority in the USA, and reaching for the term Evangelical in hopes of grabbing a statistically lower grab of the population share and then calling that a minority is disingenuous. 2) Hoping for a complete overturn of abortion DOES NOT represent an exercise in 'religious freedom.' How does asserting one's own personal religious viewpoint onto others constitute an expression of religious freedom? Is it not more truthful to say instead that religious freedom means you can choose for yourself - and sometimes by extension in meaningful circumstances - and your family whether abortion is an option for YOU by way of exercising that religious doctrine that would inform this matter. That is your 'religious freedom.' It is NOT to inform the lives of others in a way that satisfies the fulfillment of your doctrine."

Ask Mr Obama!"
10040,"Conservative spin notwithstanding, an assessment of those involved in all this shows Trudeau in the best light. Let's consider: Harper - 'involved' only in what his reactions are, he has been sensible to stay quiet. He probably hasn't even had to instruct Trudeau's known detractors to use the situation. Neutral rating. NDP MP 1 - the one who hasn't said anything has certainly been dragged further into something than she appears to have intended. Might be a little annoyed with her colleague and hopefully won't be exposed unintentionally. Neutral rating. Lib MP 1 - tangentially alleged harasser of NDP MP 1. Possibly subject to an unfair accusation; possibly guilty of something. Rating suspended pending further info. NDP MP 2 - Exposed as a loopy flake with poor judgement, possibly worse. Negative rating. Lib MP 2 - Wrongly accused of assault, but presumably facing serious marital challenges. Negative rating. Trudeau - Acted appropriately, sequestering but not punishing the accused, and seeking the jurisdiction of Parliament's chief officer. Positive rating, albeit pyrrhic. Speaker Schneer - A pathetic performance and complete abdication of initiative. Is he consulting with the boys in short pants? Negative rating. Mulcair - The most complex case. I don't think he comes out looking good at all:-either his MP went to Trudeau in preference to him, or with is prompting; and-his indulgence of silly accusations and murky processes don't jive with his aspirations to a rationalist, institutionalist image. Negative rating."

5348,"'….doubters and deniers of the reality of climate change.' What reality? Anthropogenic global warming or man-made climate change is at best an unproven hypothesis. The UN's IPCC computer models and fear-mongering predictions (which are merely cooked-up opinions, NOT objective, scientific data) have all been spectacularly wrong. To date there hasn't been any global warming for 17 years and 10 years, whilst during that time carbon dioxide (i.e. CO2, not a pollutant but a harmless trace gas essential to life on earth) levels did rise. Anything happening, or not, in the Arctic cannot be ascribed to global warming because there hasn't been any for almost two decades. Any climate change being observed is simply nature at work. Isn't it time for this newspaper's reporters and editors to tell readers the truth instead of continuing to propagandize the deception of a global climate emergency, and thereby aiding and abetting those whose global governance agenda is to deprive us of our money, our freedoms, and our sovereignty?"

In more than one speech to their base he has expressed his total disregard for our Parliament and system of government. It is well researched and footnoted."

In both cases, the public did not embrace the policies of conservatism, they were too busy turffing out the previous government. In 2008, Obama benefited from the public's anger at George W. and in 2015, the dislike for Stephen Harper was palpable. Most elections are about choosing the least of the evils.

But lets slash firefighter salaries in half, close a dozen stations, lay off a few hundred firefighters, and even privatize so I can save a whopping $70 a year on my property tax only to give an extra $500 a year to cover my increase in home insurance. Ummm, doesn't make sense to me."

5473,"Konrad - you obviously didn't read today's editorial. That article says: 'There are three major drivers of health-care costs – hospitals, drugs and physicians'. What it doesn't say is what percentage of the whopping $51.8 billion these three components represent. An accurate report would have provided that info. I for one would like to know how much of that $51.8 billion is spent on other warm body costs besides the doctors. There are the administrators and worker bees, there are the nurses and other medical support people, etc. I'm sure their costs far exceed monies spent on doctors. Singling out the doctors and not properly describing their gross versus net salaries is a misrepresentation of facts. You're right about the 'team game' - that applies to all of the Ontario public sector. But you're not mentioning the other greedy unions that the Ontario government caters to to buy votes - you're only singling out the doctors who only represent 14,000 or so votes versus 140, 000 union votes. Poor reporting with a Liberal spin!"

1389,REMEMBER: Harper and the CPC cheated in their first election win (2006) using the highly organized and Nation-wide scam to launder money and exceed our Election Spending regulations. They stonewalled the EC investigation (which took FIVE years) but pleaded 'GUILTY' to cheating in 2011. Harper is a cheat and the entire CPC culture is one of deception and lies. They have never won a clean election and they are not about to start. This act is one more step in their plan to win dishonestly. Harper is the worst Prime Minister in Canadian history and the most dangerous.

3088,"It's clear that many of the commenters and readers have little depth of knowledge when it comes to First Nations issues, or sadly Canadian history. The author of the article is no better. It's sad that our public school system has failed us so badly, that so many know so little about this important matter. People seem very concerned with the amount of money sent to reserves, what is done with it, and seeing First Nations people 'go out and get jobs'. What I'm seeing here is that people think First Nations should hurry up and do a better job of assimilating, so we can stop supporting them. As a child, I read stories about the past, when white people killed indians and stole their land. I was pleased to know that in First World countries like Canada, we no longer do that. As an adult, I am shocked to see that so many people believe that that is actually true, and that no longer are we still killing indians and stealing their land, but that people actually believe we are not doing that, and are graciously supporting them instead. If you care about this issue, please, please go out and actually read about it, don't just pontificate from your current point of view. Assimilation is not the answer and it's not about giving handouts. It's 2013, can we stop pretending we're not still stealing indians' land? If actually stopping doing it might be too much to ask."

And if Canadians overcome their myths, pretensions, hypocrisies, deceptions, and delusions, equality might someday be a 'core Canadian value'. There are way too many misconceptions to discuss here. But I will mention one important false perception that is at the core of inequality in a nation that is purported to be a democracy but isn't. In a democracy there is purported to be equal justice for all. That is a core value of democracy. But obviously there is no equal justice for all in a country where the majority cannot afford to hire a lawyer. No lawyer means no justice. No justice means no democracy. No democracy means no equality. Canada is an elitist plutocracy. As long as our economy and our political system doesn't work for all, there can be no democracy. As long as there is increasing elitist inequality in our economy, in our political system, in all our institutions, in our everyday lives, women have a great deal of work to do in changing the hearts and minds of those, male and female, with the power to further gender equality. Women are like a football player who runs 50 yards downfield towards the goal line then fumbles the ball."

Whether or not a scarf is truly a 'must' for Muslims is not important -she thinks it is and stood in court for all to see. Instead of justice she got a tongue lashing from a rather unintelligent and ignorant judge who sees herself as the arbiter of fashion and 'appropriate' dress. Can anyone tell me how this scarf will imperil the administration of justice in Canada any more so than someone, for example, wearing a kilt, or a man a clerical collar in court, etc. etc. Fire the judge and get someone in there with more than a room temperature IQ"

She discovered terrible wrongdoing - and refused to stay silent about it. She tells Nisha Lilia Diu her incredible story, now the subject of a film starring Rachel Weisz. Excerps: Then one day the body of a skimpily dressed Ukrainian girl came floating down the River Bosna. Soon after, a Moldovan girl was found wandering the river banks. Dozens of girls began turning up at Bolkovac's station with 'eerily similar' stories: They'd taken a job abroad as a waitress or cleaner or nanny - often at the insistence of their own families - but during the journey everything had gone wrong. They were taken somewhere else altogether, forcibly stripped and sold to someone who humiliated, beat and raped them into dead-eyed submission. Now they were imprisoned in brothels in Bosnia. 'People ask me what's true,' says the film's director, Larysa Kondracki. 'But it's barely scratching the surface. We had to tone it down.' The problem was so widespread, says Rees (now secretary general of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom), 'Kathy ended up having time to deal with nothing but trafficking.' Girls who escaped were frequently found – sometimes grabbed outside safe houses – and brutally punished by their sellers ( Can't be said on G&M but what is a b should be a p: bimp, with the others made to watch. But that wasn't the only reason they wouldn't testify. 'They didn't expect [the police] to help them,' says Bolkovac. She discovered numerous individuals in the Bosnian and UN police (which was made up of some 1,800 officers from 45 countries) who were not only using trafficked prostitutes but were on the traffickers' pay-roll.

It's frustrating, because in many ways the Globe is an excellent newspaper, with good reporters and columnists, and good coverage of a wide range of issues. But the Editorial Board is clearly not of the same calibre as Globe employees, and appears too often to be beholden to interests other than good journalism and responsible opinion. I cancelled my subscription today in protest. No, I don't want the next 6 months at 50% off. No, I don't want the next 3 months for 99 cents. I want to tell the Board that their attitudes on a number of issues, and their respect - or lack of it - for their readers needs a shake-up. As the major newspaper in the country, and a critical player in our very thin media industry, it has to take its responsibilities more seriously than it does.

The current problems with the Senate are a result Harper's ineptitude and possibly purposeful maligning of the Upper House. The Senate has, over the years been very effective in its role as a second chamber. It has on several occasions sent legislation back to the house for clarification so as to be constitutionally sound. Without that input, the cost of challenges would rise into the hundreds of millions. Only once has this chamber ever over-ridden the will of Parliament and wouldn't you know it, it happened under Harper's watch.

I am sure that sound science must -- and will -- win out in the long run and convince not only scientists but also the public and politicians that climate change is almost all natural, and that a modest warming, should it occur, is good for humanity overall. The revelations of ClimateGate will be very helpful here and show how a gang of determined climatologists was able to con almost everyone by cooking the data and stifling any scientific criticism from 'skeptics.' Of course, 'long run' may mean many more years -- during which the alarmists will try to impose policies that produce great economic hardships for no good reason. I fear especially those who have learned to game the system and are using global warming scares to enrich themselves at our expense. I won't mention names but you know who they are: Utopians who believe that global governance will lead to a better world; Luddites who oppose technological advance and economic growth; international bureaucrats and profiteers who want power and money. If they ever gain the upper hand, the world may have a difficult time recovering.

But those of us that do, are afraid that his steamroller tactics and lack of empathy, and his careless lack of preparation for the job could cause major problems. That's not whining. That's concern, because there's so much at stake. I fear him because he chose Bannon, a man who wants to shake things up in a major way. If Trump follows his lead, we're in for a rollercoaster ride. Many of us are in favour of change but slow careful incremental change arising out of consensus is much better than sudden upheaval."
8045,Trudeau was nothing but a sneering intellectual who hated everyone who didnt fall at his feet. A socialist well indoctrinated with the mommy philosophy of liberal socialism he hated male authority figures and had complete disdain for anything military. He like the other liberal idiot named Chretien decimated our military. But of course his Charter of (Criminal) Rights the most nefarious document ever penned in a free society is worshiped by asylum seeking criminals worldwide. But I will give him credit for one thing... he did save one of Canada's great natural treasures Nahanni National Park.
6208,"Good to see Canada finally wake up from its 9 year slumber to get rid of the incompetent, hate-mongering, lying, corrupt Harper CPC regime. The Harper regime was a Govt propped up by billions in propaganda and pork - elected on myth vs merit, a totally artificial, totally incompetent waste of 9 years. I expect that over the next few years we will learn about just some of their corrupt excesses and just how badly they have left our country's position. eg: It will take years to find out exactly where they spent our money (eg - billions during the 'Action Plan', and budgeted money that was held back for partisan spending elsewhere). It will take months, possibly years to get the real picture behind Canada's fiscal position. Good riddance to the Harper CPC and good luck to the true, honourable Conservatives left in Canada (not the likes of Kenney and Poilievre) to take back the party."

Remember Jerry McGuire yelling 'Show me the MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!' - the problem is that our politicians respond to them with sure, Show me the VOTES!!! The taxpayer is out in the cold picking up the cheque under threat of violence. We need to fire the unions and open up all these jobs to competition."
